IMPORTANT: LICENSOR PROVIDES LICENSED SOFTWARE TO LICENSEE (HEREINAFTER
“CUSTOMER”) UNDER THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE “AGREEMENT”). THIS
AGREEMENT GOVERNS CUSTOMER’S INSTALLATION AND USE OF THE VERSION OF THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE IDENTIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT ORDER, OR IF NOT ACQUIRED
VIA A PRODUCT ORDER, CUSTOMER’S DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION OR USE OF THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THIS
AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS ON CUSTOMER USE OF THE
SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES AND CONTROLS OVER ANY OTHER TERMS
PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER REGARDING CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE,
WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, UNLESS A DIFFERENT WRITTEN AGREEMENT IS EXPRESSLY
REFERENCED IN A PRODUCT ORDER OR EXECUTED BY LICENSOR AND CUSTOMER THAT
SUPPLEMENTS OR SUPERSEDES ALL OR PORTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SALES TRANSACTION.
1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms in this Agreement are defined as follows:
“Additional License Authorization” or “ALA” means the additional specific software license terms that
govern the use of a given software product, including (but not limited to) the provisions of the Non-

Micro Focus at Customer’s request.
“Customer” or “Licensee” means the legal entity or individual that is identified in the applicable Product
Order or who has rightfully received a license to the Licensed Product.
“Documentation” means the user documentation Micro Focus makes available for Licensed Software.
“Licensed Product” means Licensed Software and Documentation.
“Licensed Software” means the executable version of the software listed in the Product Order or
otherwise provided to or rightfully acquired by Customer. This Agreement will govern the use of any update
to the Licensed Software that Customer receives pursuant to a separate support and maintenance
agreement as described in Section 7 (Support and Maintenance) below, unless such update contains,
comes with, or is otherwise specifically governed by a different end user license agreement.
“Micro Focus” or “Licensor” means the applicable Micro Focus entity and its affiliates having intellectual
property rights in Licensed Product.
“Open Source Software” means software or other material embedded in or made available with a
Licensed Product where such software or other material is made available under an “open source license”

to, those licenses meeting all the criteria prescribed in the Open Source Definition provided by the Open
Source Initiative (https://opensource.org/osd).
“Product Order” means a purchase order or purchase order alternative agreed to by the parties for the
sale of a license(s) of one or more specific items of Licensed Software to Customer.

“Warranty Period” means the 90-day period starting from the date Licensed Software is delivered to
Customer.
2. PRODUCT ORDERS. The licensing of software products takes place under Product Orders which (unless
stated otherwise in the Product Order) incorporate the terms of this Agreement. Any terms that conflict or
are in addition to the terms of this Agreement or any applicable ALA (“Inconsistent Terms”) in a purchase
order or other document issued by Customer are rejected by Micro Focus and have no force and effect. If
there is any Inconsistent Term(s) in a Product Order, such Inconsistent Term(s) shall not apply except
where such Inconsistent Term(s) is contained in a Micro Focus quote or a Product Order that is signed by
both parties.
3. LICENSING.
a. License. Except as specifically permitted in the applicable ALA, or as described in Section 3b
(Evaluation Licenses), Micro Focus and its affiliates, respectively deliver and license to Customer the
Licensed Products under a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use
Licensed Software and its Documentation as set out in this Agreement and/or the applicable ALA and
solely for Customer’s internal business operations and not for further distribution or commercialization.
b. Evaluation Licenses. Except as specifically permitted in the applicable ALA, when Micro Focus and its
affiliates, respectively deliver and license the Licensed Products solely for evaluation, Customer
receives a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use Licensed Products for
internal evaluation and testing purposes only, and not for any development, production, distribution or
commercial purpose (“Evaluation License”). The term of an Evaluation License will be 30 days
starting from the date Licensed Product is delivered (i.e., made available for download or physically
delivered) to Customer (“Evaluation Term”), unless Micro Focus authorizes a different period in
writing. The Licensed Product is provided “as is” and there are no warranties or obligations for Micro
Focus to provide support. The Evaluation License terminates at the end of the Evaluation Term, and
Customer is required to return, or, if Micro Focus so directs, delete and destroy, all copies of such
Licensed Product and provide Micro Focus with written confirmation of its compliance with this
provision within 30 days of the end of the Evaluation Term. The Evaluation License for any pre-release
or beta versions of Licensed Software (“Pre-Release Software”) shall be for a term of 90 days unless
Micro Focus authorizes a different period in writing. Customer agrees to promptly report to Micro Focus
all problems (including errors, failures, nonconforming results, and unexpected performances) and any
comments regarding the Pre-Release Software and to timely respond to all questionnaires submitted
by Micro Focus regarding the results of Customer’s testing of the Pre-Release Software. Micro Focus
may choose not to release a final version of the Pre-Release Software or, even if released, to alter
prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, release dates, general availability, or other
characteristics of the Pre-Release Software.
4. USE RESTRICTIONS.
a. Except as specifically permitted in the applicable ALA or Documentation, Customer will not, directly or
indirectly:
i. Use Licensed Software for time-sharing, outsourcing, hosting, service bureau or like use, or permit
access by, or use for the benefit of, any third party;
ii. Modify or create derivative works of Licensed Software;
iii. Reverse engineer, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of
Licensed Software, except to the extent permitted by applicable law;
iv. Unbundle component parts of Licensed Software for separate use, where Licensed Software with
multiple components is provided to Customer as a single product;
v. Publish or disclose to third parties any evaluation or benchmarking of Licensed Software; or
vi. Alter, destroy, or remove any proprietary notices or labels on or embedded in Licensed Software.
Micro Focus EULA - January 2, 2023 Page 2 of 8
--- Page 3 ---
b. Customer may make a reasonable number of archival copies of Licensed Software and
Documentation, and will reproduce all copyright and other proprietary rights notices appearing in or on
Licensed Products, including notices of all third party suppliers, on all permitted copies.
5. TERM. This Agreement and the license term for the Licensed Software granted herein is perpetual,
unless a subscription/term license has been purchased by Customer (in which case the license term shall
be set forth in the Product Order or ALA), and is subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 6
(Termination). If Customer has purchased a subscription/term license, such license shall automatically
terminate upon expiry of such subscription/term, unless earlier terminated under Section 6.
6. TERMINATION. Except as set forth herein, either party may terminate this Agreement, and/or any license
granted, on written notice if the other party materially breaches the terms of this Agreement, or any
applicable ALA or Product Order and does not cure the breach within 30 days of the date such party is
notified of such breach. Micro Focus may terminate this Agreement, along with any or all licenses then
in effect with Customer, immediately by giving Customer written notice of termination in the event that (i)
Customer becomes insolvent, has a receiver appointed, or files for or has filed against it, liquidation,
bankruptcy or analogous proceedings; or (ii) Customer infringes or misappropriates the intellectual
property rights of Micro Focus. Termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies a
party may have. In the event of any termination, Customer’s license(s) to install, access or use the
Licensed Software will immediately terminate, and Customer shall destroy and erase all copies of such
Licensed Software in its possession or control and provide written certification to Micro Focus that it has
complied with this provision. Early termination of this Agreement or any Product Order will not entitle
Customer to any credit or refund or reimbursement of any previously paid fees.
7. SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE. Customer is not entitled to any updates to Licensed Software, unless
Customer purchases (or may receive under a subscription/term license) maintenance and support services
pursuant to Micro Focus’ then current applicable standard maintenance and support agreement (which is
found at https://www.microfocus.com/support-and-services/maintenance-and-support-agreements/ or can
be provided by Micro Focus at Customer’s request).
8. HARDWARE. In the event that Micro Focus provides Licensed Software embedded in an appliance, or
provides hardware to Customer for use in conjunction with Licensed Software, additional hardware terms
and conditions will apply. In all other instances, Customer will obtain and install any necessary hardware
for proper installation and implementation of Licensed Software.
9. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. If Customer has Micro Focus or a Micro Focus affiliate perform any services
with respect to Licensed Software (e.g., installation, implementation, maintenance, consulting or training),
Micro Focus or its affiliate will provide those services at its then current standard terms and conditions and
rates unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. Customer may agree to enter into a professional
services engagement with Micro Focus or its affiliate through a separate agreement or statement of work.
10. SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE. If Customer purchases access to an online software solution that Micro
Focus makes available for use through a network connection (“SaaS”), then additional terms and
conditions will apply governing Customer’s access to and use of SaaS.
11. LIMITED WARRANTY. Micro Focus warrants for the Warranty Period that the Licensed Software
substantially conforms in all material respects to the Documentation, and any media on which Micro Focus
provides Licensed Software is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.
Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for breach of such warranty is (i) repair or replacement of the
applicable Licensed Software or media free of charge so that it substantially conforms to Documentation
or (ii) if Micro Focus reasonably determines such remedy is not economically or technically feasible, a
refund of the license fee and any maintenance fee paid for the Licensed Software for the current year. The
license to use such Licensed Software will immediately terminate when Customer receives the refund.
The warranties in Section 11 (Limited Warranty) do not apply if the defects in Licensed Software or media
result from: (i) failure to use Licensed Software in accordance with Documentation, this Agreement or the
applicable ALA; (ii) malfunction of Customer’s equipment or network; (iii) accident, neglect, or abuse; (iv)
service by any unauthorized person; (v) other software used by Customer not provided by Micro Focus, or
for which Licensed Software is not designed or licensed for such use; or (vi) any other cause occurring
Micro Focus EULA - January 2, 2023 Page 3 of 8
--- Page 4 ---
after initial delivery of Licensed Software or media to Customer, unless directly caused by Micro Focus.
For purposes of this Agreement, Licensed Software is deemed delivered when it is first made available for
download by, or physically delivered to, Customer.
Micro Focus has no responsibility for any claims made outside the Warranty Period.
The warranties in Section 11 (Limited Warranty) also apply to Third Party Components, but do not apply
to (i) any free-of-charge Licensed Software or updates provided following the Warranty Period; or (ii) third
party software that is not a Third Party Component.
12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. Except for the limited warranties in Section 11 (Limited Warranty),
Licensed Products are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. To the extent permitted by
law, all implied or statutory terms, conditions, representations, and warranties (including without
limitation all terms, conditions, representations and warranties regarding merchantability, quality
or fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement, or that may arise out of course of
dealing, usage or trade practice) are expressly disclaimed and excluded to the extent allowed by
applicable law. The limited warranties in this Agreement are provided on the basis that Customer
is procuring Licensed Products for the purposes of a business and not for household or consumer
use. Micro Focus does not warrant that operation of Licensed Software will be uninterrupted or
error-free. Customer has sole responsibility to select Licensed Software that works with other
software, applications or systems to achieve intended results.
13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
a. Liability Cap. In no event will any liability of one party to the other party arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement exceed the greater of (i) $250,000 or (ii) the total fees paid by
Customer for the affected Licensed Software in the relevant Product Order(s) (including related
maintenance and support). Nothing in Section 13a (Liability Cap) shall limit either party’s
liability for: willful misconduct or fraudulent misrepresentation; unauthorized use of
intellectual property; breach of license; breach of confidentiality, excluding breach of duties
for handling Personal Information (defined in Section 18 Privacy); death or bodily injury caused
by negligence; non-payment of amounts owed; or any liability which may not be excluded or
limited by applicable law.
b. Mutual Disclaimer of Consequential Damages. In no event will either party be liable for any
indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive or similar damages; loss of profits,
business, data or programs (including, but not limited to, the cost of recovery or replacement
of such data or programs); loss, damage or any costs due to interruption, delay or inability to
use Licensed Software, whether arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, even if
informed of the possibility of such damages in advance.
c. Scope. The limitations and disclaimers in Section 13a (Liability Cap) and Section 13b (Mutual
Disclaimer of Consequential Damages) apply to all causes of action, including but not limited to, breach
of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation and other torts.
d. Exclusive Remedy. The remedies in this Agreement are the parties’ exclusive remedies and the
limitations of Section 13a (Liability Cap) and 13b (Mutual Disclaimer of Consequential Damages) apply
even if these remedies fail of their essential purpose. Customer may have other rights, including
consumer rights, under the laws of the state or country where it is located.
e. Free-of-Charge Software. If Micro Focus provides Customer with any Licensed Software free-of-
charge or under an Evaluation License, to the extent permitted by law, Micro Focus and its affiliates
will not be responsible for any loss or damage to Customer, its customers, or any third parties caused
by that Licensed Software which is free-of-charge.
14. OWNERSHIP. Micro Focus International plc and its affiliates and their suppliers own all intellectual
property rights in Licensed Products, and authorize Micro Focus to distribute Licensed Products under this
Agreement. Customer’s only rights in Licensed Products are the express licenses referenced in this
Agreement or the applicable ALA.
Micro Focus EULA - January 2, 2023 Page 4 of 8
--- Page 5 ---
15. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Open Source Software and Third Party
Software are governed by the terms of their respective licenses and not the terms of this Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable ALA. Information about the Open Source
Software may be found in a file accompanying the Licensed Software or in the Documentation or ALA.
16. LICENSE FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS. Customer will pay the license fees set forth in the applicable
Product Order for Licensed Software within 30 days of the date of invoice. Software license fees are non-
refundable, except as provided in Section 11 (Limited Warranty) above, and will be paid without deduction
or tax withholding. Software License fees are exclusive of any transportation charges, sales, use, value
added, and other applicable taxes and duties, and all such amounts will be paid or reimbursed by
Customer. Customer will be liable for all outstanding past due amounts, which will accrue interest (at the
rate of 1.5% per month compounded or the maximum rate permitted by law if lower) and any collection
costs for recovery of past due amounts.
17. LICENSE VERIFICATION. Micro Focus has the right to verify Customer’s compliance with licenses to the
Licensed Software. (See Micro Focus License Compliance Charter at
http://supportline.microfocus.com/licensing/licVerification.aspx, which Micro Focus can also provide at
Customer’s request.)
Customer agrees to keep records sufficient to show Customer’s compliance, including serial numbers;
license keys; logs; records identifying machines on which Licensed Software is installed, accessed, or
from which Licensed Software can be accessed; the number of different users accessing or authorized to
access Licensed Software (if applicable); and licensing metrics, reports, and copies of Licensed Software.
Micro Focus may require Customer to provide information about its deployment of Licensed Software,
which may be in the form of a questionnaire. Customer will have a reasonable time to complete the
questionnaire (or other form of request) and provide it to Micro Focus with an authorized Customer
signatory certifying the accuracy of the information furnished. Upon 10 days prior written notice, Micro
Focus or its designated representative may inspect Customer’s records, systems and facilities, during
Customer’s normal business hours, to verify compliance with licenses to the Licensed Software. Customer
agrees to cooperate with such verification. Information obtained will be used solely for compliance
purposes and will otherwise be subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 21 (Confidential
Information) of this Agreement. If Customer has engaged in unlicensed installation, use of, or access to
Licensed Software or infringed or misappropriated intellectual property rights in Licensed Software, or has
otherwise breached this Agreement or an ALA (a “Non-Compliance”), without prejudice to Micro Focus’
other rights or remedies, including, without limitation, injunctive relief, within thirty (30) days’ notice of such
Non-Compliance, Customer agrees to purchase sufficient licenses and or subscriptions and associated
support and maintenance (12 months forward and any applicable back support and maintenance) to cure
the Non-Compliance, by paying Micro Focus’ current (as of the date of such additional purchase) list
license fees and support and maintenance fees to Micro Focus, plus interest (compounded at 1.5%
monthly or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law if lower) for such additional licenses from the
commencement of the Non-Compliance until payment of the aforementioned fees, with interest payable
even if an invoice was not issued at the time the Non-Compliance occurred. If Customer’s Non-Compliance
results in an underpayment of license fees of 5% or greater, Customer shall also reimburse Micro Focus
for the reasonable cost of such audit in addition to other amounts due.
18. PRIVACY. Customer is solely responsible for, and assumes all liability with respect to, its own collection,
processing, storage, and transfer of any user data, including personally identifiable information, personal
health and financial information, and other forms of personal information (collectively, “Personal
Information”). Customer is solely responsible for notifying its users of proper use of such data. Customer
is solely responsible for assessing the Licensed Product or any related product or service for compliance
with any industry requirements applicable to Customer. Each party must comply with its respective
obligations under all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards regarding data collection and
data privacy that apply to use of Licensed Software. Personal information or customer data that Customer
provides to Micro Focus for the purpose of receiving products or services will be handled in accordance
with the Micro Focus Privacy & Cookies Notice (https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/legal#web-cookies)
and the privacy and data security provisions in the applicable ALA.
Micro Focus EULA - January 2, 2023 Page 5 of 8
--- Page 6 ---
19. USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION. To the extent permitted by law, Customer expressly consents to
the collection and use of information about Customer’s purchase, installation and use of Licensed Software
and the computer systems on which it is installed or accessed as necessary to fulfill the Product Order and
provide the Licensed Product, for security and licensing purposes and to improve Micro Focus products
and services.
20. CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. Customer agrees that, should it provide Micro Focus with any feedback or
suggestions regarding Licensed Products (“Feedback”), Micro Focus and its affiliates will be free to use
all such Feedback, including (but not limited to) all intellectual property rights in and to such Feedback, in
their discretion and for any purpose, without obligation of any kind to Customer.
21. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Information exchanged under or in connection with this Agreement,
including all information pertaining to Pre-Release Software, will be treated as confidential if identified as
confidential at time of disclosure, or if the circumstances of disclosure reasonably indicate such information
should be treated as confidential. Confidential information may only be used for the purpose of fulfilling
obligations or exercising rights under or in connection with this Agreement, and shared with employees,
affiliates, agents or contractors with a need to know such information to support that purpose, who are
contractually bound to protect its confidentiality. Confidential information will be protected using a
reasonable degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure for three years from date of receipt.
These obligations do not cover information that (i) was known or becomes known to the receiving party
without a duty of confidentiality; (ii) is independently developed by the receiving party; (iii) becomes publicly
available without breach of this Agreement; (iv) is disclosed with the disclosing party’s prior written consent;
or (v) where disclosure is required by law, a court or government agency. Should the receiving party be
required to reveal confidential information under subpoena, court order or other operation of law, the
receiving party will provide reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party and request a protective order,
if available.
22. INDEMNIFICATION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT. Micro Focus will
defend and/or settle any claims against Customer that Licensed Products furnished under this Agreement
infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party (“IP Infringement Claim”), provided: (i) Customer
promptly notifies Micro Focus in writing of the IP Infringement Claim; (ii) Micro Focus has sole control of
the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) Customer reasonably cooperates with Micro
Focus in the defense of the IP Infringement Claim.
Micro Focus will pay all damages, costs, and expenses finally awarded (or agreed to by settlement) for
any such IP Infringement Claim. Micro Focus will pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Customer for cooperation in the defense of the IP Infringement Claim. If, however, Customer wants
separate legal representation, Customer will be responsible for the costs and fees of its separate counsel.
Should any Licensed Products provided under this Agreement become or, in Micro Focus' opinion, likely
become, the subject of an IP Infringement Claim, Micro Focus may replace or modify affected Licensed
Product so as to make it non-infringing and materially equivalent, or procure for Customer the right to
continue using it. If neither alternative is reasonably available, once Customer has returned or destroyed
all copies of the affected Licensed Product, Micro Focus will refund to Customer the full amount paid for
affected Licensed Product less straight line depreciation on a five-year basis from date of delivery.
Micro Focus is not responsible for unauthorized use of Licensed Products, and has no obligations under
Section 22 (Indemnification for Intellectual Property Rights Infringement), to the extent infringement results
from (i) compliance with Customer's designs or instructions, (ii) a modification not authorized in writing by
an authorized Micro Focus signatory, (iii) use or combination with software, equipment, or data not
provided by Micro Focus, (iv) non-licensed use; or (v) Third Party Software or Open Source Software.
23. MISCELLANEOUS.
a. Assignment. Micro Focus may assign this Agreement and any Product Orders to a parent or an
affiliate. Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or any Product Orders) or any of its
rights or duties hereunder, including (but not limited to) by operation of law, without Micro Focus’ prior
written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, and payment of any applicable assignment
or transfer fee. Any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in a change in the ownership
of more than 50% of the voting equity of Customer will be deemed an assignment for purposes of this
Micro Focus EULA - January 2, 2023 Page 6 of 8
--- Page 7 ---
provision. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement (or a Product Order) not in accordance with
Section 23a (Assignment) will be null and void.

or causes of action, whether in contract, tort or statute, based on, arising under or relating to this
Agreement, will be governed and enforced as follows: If Customer’s applicable place of business is
located in North America, all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement are governed by the
laws of the state of Delaware, U.S.A. If Customer is located in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil,

the courts of the country determining the applicable law, except that the courts of the State of Delaware
shall have exclusive jurisdiction in North America, and Micro Focus will be allowed to apply for
injunctive relief in any jurisdiction. Each party agrees to be subject to the above-described jurisdiction
and waives any right it may have to object to such venue, including objections based on personal
jurisdiction or inconvenient forum. The prevailing party in any proceeding has the right to recover costs
and reasonable attorneys’ fees as awarded by the court or arbitrator.
c. Export Control. Micro Focus and Customer will comply with their respective responsibilities as
exporters and importers under laws and regulations applicable to the export, import or other transfer
of the software, services and technology provided by Micro Focus under this Agreement, including the
export, import and sanctions laws of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions. If Customer

in this Agreement and the Documentation included with the Micro Focus supplied products and
services. With purchases from a reseller, the applicable pricing and payment terms are as set out in
the separate agreement between Customer and the reseller, and any terms in this Agreement related
to Micro Focus pricing and payments shall not apply. Micro Focus is not responsible for the acts or
omissions of the reseller, or for any other products or services that it supplies to Customer.

软件的某些适用产品和组件（例如字体软件、 Acrobat、After Effects、Adobe Presenter、Contribute、
Flash Player、Flash Builder、Digital Publishing Suite和Adobe Runtime）的特殊规定进行补充。
2.1.2 许可证类型。
2.1.2.1 无序列号软件。在许可期限内未提供序列号的本软件或其某些部分，仅可出于演示、评估和
培训目的，作为组织部署计划的一部分，在许可期限内于任意数量的兼容计算机上安装和使用，这
种使用所产生的任何输出文件或其他材料只能用于内部的非商业和非生产用途。无序列号软件按“原
样”提供。访问和使用此类无序列号软件创建的任何输出文件的风险完全由客户承担。
2.1.2.2 评估版软件。本软件或其某些部分如果在提供时附带指明“评估用途”的序列号或其他类似
字样（例如在单独协议中作为“EVAL（评估）”提供的软件或序列号）（“评估版软件”），则只

产生的任何输出文件或其他材料只能用于内部的非商业和非生产用途。评估版软件按“原样”提供。
访问和使用此类评估版软件创建的任何输出文件的风险完全由客户承担。

机上安装和使用订阅版。在使用订阅版的计算机符合授权数量的情况下，Adobe可能允许客户在许
可期限内，于同一计算机上安装并使用订阅版的前一版本和当前版本。客户同意Adobe可随时更改
订阅版中所包含的软件类型（例如特定组件、版本、平台、语言等），且不因此类更改对客户承担
任何责任。继续访问订阅版的要求：(a)再次连接因特网以激活、更新和验证许可证，(b) Adobe或
其授权代理商收到再次订阅的费用，以及(c)客户接受
--- Page 16 ---

接受上述条款及条件。如果Adobe未收到再次订阅的费用或无法定期验证许可证，则在Adobe收
到费用或验证许可证之前，本软件可能会在未另行通知的情况下而无法使用。
2.1.3 便携式计算机或家用计算机使用。在满足第2.1.4条所述限制的情况下，依照第2.1条安装
本软件的计算机的主要用户（“主要用户”），可以在一台便携式计算机或家用计算机上再安装
一份本软件，仅供其个人使用，但在主要计算机上使用本软件时，不得同时在便携式计算机或家
用计算机上使用本软件。
2.1.4 对批量被许可人二次使用的限制。如果本软件是由任何被许可人（教育批量被许可人除外）根
据Adobe批量许可计划或协议（例如Adobe批量许可证）而获得，则根据第2.1.3条执行的本软
件第二份副本必须仅用于满足该批量被许可人的利益和业务需求。
2.1.5 双启动平台。本软件仅允许在特定操作系统平台上使用。客户必须购买单独的许可证，才能在
每个操作系统平台上使用本软件。例如，如果客户想要将本软件安装于一台设备上的Mac OS和
Windows操作系统平台（即双启动机器），则必须首先获得两个单独的本软件许可证。即使以同一
媒体向客户交付了针对不同操作系统平台而设计的本软件的两种版本，情况也是如此。
2.1.6 从服务器分发。客户可以依照文档第2条的规定，将本软件的映像复制到其内部网络（“服务
器”）的计算机文件服务器上，供同一内部网络内的计算机下载和安装本软件。
2.1.7 服务器使用。
2.1.7.1 客户可按照单独购买文档或本文档的规定，且在符合本协议中所述许可限制的情况下，本着
允许同一内部网络内的计算机用户（“网络用户”）访问和使用本软件的唯一目的，而在服务器上
安装本软件。访问服务器上此类软件的网络用户称为“服务器软件用户”。服务器软件用户的总数
（并非同时使用的用户数）不得超过授权数量。例如，如果客户已购买10个软件许可证（授权数量
为10），且客户选择在服务器上安装本软件，则客户仅可允许最多10个服务器软件用户访问本软
件（即使在客户可能拥有超过10个网络用户，或同时使用本软件的用户不足10个的情况下亦然）。
2.1.7.2 上述情况不允许客户（直接或者通过命令、数据或指令）安装或访问本软件，包括但不限于：
(a)从或向不属于客户内部网络的计算机使用本软件；(b)用于启用对公众开放的Web托管工作组或
Web托管服务；(c)由任何个人或实体使用、下载、复制本软件，或通过其他方式受益于本软件的功
能，除非得到Adobe的许可；(d)将本软件作为某系统、工作流程或服务的组成部分，让超过授权
数量的用户使用；或(e)用于由非个人用户启动的操作（如自动服务器处理）。
2.2 会员资格。第2.2条适用于已购买Creative Cloud会员资格等基于会员资格的许可证或服务的客
户（统称“会员资格”）。
2.2.1 与会员资格相关的Adobe在线服务。在客户持续遵守本协议并支付适用会员费（如果有）的
情况下，作为会员资格的一部分，Adobe将授予客户相应的域范围内的非独占有限权利，以按照本
协议所述条款及附加使用条款（如下文第14.1.3条中定义的条款），访问并使用本软件及相关Adobe
在线服务（详情请见第16.4.1条）。
--- Page 17 ---
2.2.2 与会员资格相关的软件许可证。在客户持续遵守本协议并支付适用会员费（如果有）的情况下，
Adobe将授予客户非独占性有限许可证，以安装及使用本软件：(a)在相应的地域范围内、(b)在会员
资格存续期间（“会员资格期限”）并(c)通过符合本协议条款和适用文档的方式。会员资格期限到
期或终止后，(x)部分或全部软件可能会在未预先通知的情况下停止运行，且(y)在更新会员资格前，
客户可能无法使用本软件。本协议中所述与特定软件相关的所有条款仍然有效，且继续适用于客户
及此类软件的使用。
2.2.3 限制。客户接受下列与会员资格相关的附加条款及限制：(a) Adobe可随时更改会员资格中所
包含的软件类型（例如特定产品、组件、版本、平台、语言等），且不会因此类更改对客户承担任
何责任；(b)在会员资格期限内，客户可能要随时连接因特网并登录；(c)在不另行通知的情况下，本
软件可能随时自动连接至因特网以验证客户的会员资格；以及(d)客户可能无法支持或允许他人作为
客户使用本软件。
2.3 内容文件。除非“自述文件”、本文档或与内容文件有关的其他许可另有规定，否则客户可以使
用、展示、修改、复制和分发任何内容文件。但是，客户不得独立（即，当内容文件构成被分发产
品的主要价值时）分发内容文件，并且不得在内容文件或其派生作品中主张任何商标权利。此处所
述的规定不影响本软件的所有权（如第3条中所述）。
2.4 示例应用代码。客户可以仅出于设计、开发和测试利用Adobe软件程序开发的网站和应用程序
之目的，修改随附文档中明确标为示例代码、示例应用代码、代码片段、ActionScript类文件或示
例组件（均称为“示例应用代码”）的那部分软件程序的源代码格式；但是，只有满足下列所有条
件时，才允许客户复制和分发经修改或未经修改的示例应用代码：(a)客户仅连同其应用程序一起分
发示例应用代码的已编译目标代码版本；(b)客户不在用于网站开发的任何产品或应用程序中包含该
示例应用代码；以及(c)客户不使用Adobe名称、徽标、图标或其他Adobe商标销售其应用程序。
对于因使用或分发其应用程序所产生或导致的任何损失、损害、索赔或诉讼（包括律师费），客户
同意赔偿Adobe，使其免受损害并为其辩护。
2.5 编程语言。本软件可能包括ExtendScript SDK和Pixel Bender SDK的若干部分。在满足第2条
所规定限制的情况下，Adobe授予客户非独占性不可转让的免版税许可，以仅为在内部开发与
Adobe产品共同使用的应用程序之目的，使用ExtendScript SDK和Pixel Bender SDK中的项目。
除第2.5条明确规定的以外，不得修改或分发ExtendScript SDK或Pixel Bender SDK的任何部分。
对于因此类分发所产生或导致的任何损失、损害、索赔或诉讼（包括律师费），客户同意赔偿Adobe，
使其免受损害并为其辩护。
2.6 文档副本。客户可以按照本协议制作文档副本，连同本软件一起在内部使用，但不得超过合理必
要的数量。
3. 知识产权。
本软件及客户制作的任何授权副本均为Adobe Systems Incorporated及其供应商的知识产权，且归
其所有。本软件的结构、组织和源代码均为Adobe Systems Incorporated及其供应商的宝贵商业秘
密和保密信息。本软件受法律保护，其中包括但不限于美国和其他国家的版权法以及国际协约条款。

规定，否则客户不必安装本软件的所有组件，但不得解除捆绑本软件的组件以在不同的计算机上使
用。
4.6 不得转让。

本软件或Adobe在线服务，Adobe可以终止本协议授予的许可证，或者暂停其会员资格或对Adobe
在线服务的访问权。
5. 更新。
如果本软件是Adobe软件先前版本（“先前版本”）的更新版，则客户需保留先前版本才能使用此
更新版。因此，如果客户根据第4.6条有效地转让了此更新版，则必须与更新版一同转让先前版本。
如果客户希望将此更新版与先前版本一同使用，则仅可在安装有并正在使用先前版本的同一台计算
机上执行此操作。Adobe在许可期限内支持先前版本的所有义务可能在提供此更新版之时终止。不
得将更新版用作其他用途。Adobe可以通过额外或其他条款向客户提供其他更新版本的许可。
6. 有限担保。
除非在Adobe与软件被许可人之间的单独协议中另外说明，否则Adobe向最先购买本软件许可证
以遵照本协议的条款使用本软件的个人或实体保证，当在兼容计算机上使用本软件时，其性能在购
得后九十(90)天或许可期限（“担保期”）内与相应软件用户手册所述基本一致。与用户手册相比
存在的非实质性性能差异不构成担保权利。上述有限担保不适用于按“原样”提供的、不受Adobe
担保的下列项目：(i)补丁；(ii)字体软件；(iii)预发行版软件、试用版、启用版、评估版、产品样品、
评估版软件及本软件的非转售副本；(iv)网站、Adobe在线服务；及第三方在线服务；(v)认证文档

保索赔，必须在上述担保期内向Adobe客户支持部门提出，并附上购买证明。有关担保索赔的详细
信息，请访问http://www.adobe.com/go/support_cn。与上述担保索赔相关的Adobe及其关联公
司的全部责任，以及客户依据任意担保的唯一专有赔偿将限于根据担保索赔支持本软件、更换本软
件，或者如果经Adobe确认，无法提供支持或更换，则退回客户为本软件购买许可证的费用（如果
有），使用哪种方法将由Adobe决定。本条所阐明的有限担保将给予客户特定的法定权利。根据管
辖地区的不同，客户可能还享有其他法定权利。Adobe不在适用法律允许的范围外限制客户所享有
的担保权利。请参见第16条，了解管辖地区特定的规定，或与Adobe的客户支持部门联系。

7. 免责声明。
第6条所述的有限担保，以及依法不得排除或限制的任何法定担保和赔偿，是适用于本软件的唯一
担保及专有赔偿方式。除上述担保及任何法定担保和赔偿外，无论是依据成文法、普通法、惯例、
常例或其他原由，包括但不限于性能、安全性、不侵犯第三方权益、完整性、适销性、可不受干扰
而使用、质量满意和适用于任何特定用途的适用性，Adobe、其关联公司、供应商以及认证中心（定
义见下文）均不明示或默示任何担保、条件、陈述及条款。除上述提供的法定担保和赔偿外，均按
现况和所有错误已包含在内的条件提供本软件以及对任何网站、Adobe或第三方在线服务及认证中
心服务的访问。本免责声明在某些管辖地区可能无效。客户可能享有法律规定的不得放弃或免除的
其他担保权利。Adobe不在适用法律允许的范围外限制客户所享有的担保权利。此第7条和第8条
的条款将在本协议终止后（不论如何终止）继续有效，但这并不意味着也不表示终止本协议后有继
续使用本软件的权利。
8. 责任限制。
除Adobe提供的上述专有赔偿和法律规定不得排除或限制的任何赔偿外，Adobe、其关联公司、供
应商和认证中心在任何情况下都不对客户的任何损失、损害、索赔或费用，包括任何相应而生、间
接或附带的损害、任何利润或储蓄损失，或因业务中断、人身伤害或不能履行照顾责任或第三方索
赔而导致的任何损害承担任何责任，即使Adobe代表已被告知出现这种损失、损害、索赔或费用的
可能性，Adobe、其关联公司、供应商或认证中心也不承担责任。无论任何情况下，依照本协议或
与本协议有关的Adobe、其关联公司、供应商以及认证中心所承担的集合责任或以其他方式规定的
责任均限于购买本软件所支付的款项（如果有）。即使在实质性或严重违反本协议或违反本协议的
实质性或重要条款的情况下，本限制仍将适用。本协议规定的内容并不对因Adobe疏忽所造成的客
户死亡或个人伤害以及欺骗侵权（诈骗）加以限制。Adobe代表其关联公司、供应商及认证中心否
认、排除和/或限制责任、担保和义务，但不在其他方面或为其他目的代表其关联公司、供应商及认
证中心。
前述限制和排除情况在客户所在地适用法律允许的范围内适用。本责任限制在某些管辖地区可能无
效。客户可能依据消费者保护法和其他法律享有不得放弃的权利。Adobe不在适用法律允许的范围
外限制客户所享有的担保或赔偿。有关各管辖地区特定的声明，请参阅第16条。
9. 出口规则。
客户承认本软件受《美国出口管理法》(Export Administration Regulations, EAR)的约束，且客户将

本协议）提交给新加坡仲裁机构，并由该机构作出最终裁决。仲裁员应由双方共同挑选。如果在一
方以书面形式要求提交仲裁后的三十(30)日内未能选出仲裁员，则应由SIAC的主席代为挑选。仲裁
的语言应为英语。虽有本协议中的任何规定，Adobe或客户仍可在启动法律或仲裁程序前，或者在
程序开展的过程当中，向司法、行政或其他主管当局请求作出任何临时或保全措施，包括提供禁令
救济、具体执行或其他衡平救济，以保护其权益或者执行适于提供临时赔偿的特定条款。本协议不

16.1 无损害；欧洲经济区规定；澳大利亚强制性声明。
16.1.1 本协议不会损害任一方的法定权利，包括消费者的法定权利。例如，对购买本软件用于个人
用途、内部使用以及家用（非商业目的）的新西兰消费者，本协议适用《消费者担保法》(Consumer
Guarantees Act)。
16.1.2 如果客户在欧洲经济区(EEA)获得本软件，则其须常住EEA且是消费者（即其使用本软件是出
于非商业的个人目的），那么第6条（有限担保）不适用于客户购买和使用本软件。否则，Adobe
保证从购买之日起2年内，在兼容计算机上使用本软件时将提供适用用户手册中所指定的功能（“协
议功能”）。协议功能发生非实质性差异的，不构成任何担保权利。本担保不适用于客户基于预发
行版、试用版、启用版或产品样品使用的软件，也不适用于字体软件，或因客户修改而无法正常运
行的软件。要提出担保索赔，客户必须在该2年期间内通知Adobe客户支持部，并提供详细的软件
购买证明。Adobe将向客户核实软件是否存在缺陷，或告知客户错误是由于其未正确安装软件而引
起（在这种情况下，Adobe将提供协助）。如果软件存在缺陷，则客户可以要求Adobe退款或维
修/替换软件副本。提出要求时必须随附购买证明。如果客户的担保详情得到证实，则Adobe将满
足其维修/替换软件的要求，但要求不合理的除外（在这种情况下，Adobe将予以退款）。要获得担
保协助，请与Adobe的客户支持部门联系。
请注意，第8条（责任限制）的规定将继续适用于客户提出的与使用本软件有关的任何损害索赔。
但Adobe将负责Adobe违反本协议时可合理预见的直接损失。建议客户采取一切合理措施，特别
是备份软件和计算机数据，避免并减少损害。
本协议（特别是第16.1.2条）旨在描述客户使用本软件遇到问题时享有的权利（包括客户的法定权
利）。如果客户的法定权利大于此处规定的权利，则以客户的法定权利为准。
16.1.3 本协议的任何内容（包括第4.4条）均不限制客户根据适用法律享有的不可放弃的软件反编
译权利。例如，如果客户位于欧盟(EU)，在为了实现本软件与其他软件程序的互用性而必须对本软
件进行反编译，且已预先书面要求Adobe提供实现此类互用性而需要的信息，而Adobe未提供此
类信息的情况下，客户有权按照有关法律规定的条件对本软件进行反编译。此外，该等反编译只能
由客户或有权代表其使用本软件副本的其他人员进行。Adobe有权在提供此类信息时提出合理的条
件。Adobe按照本协议规定提供或客户按本协议规定获取的任何信息只能由客户用于协议规定之目
的，不得披露给第三方，也不得用于创建任何与本软件风格基本相似的软件或用于侵犯Adobe或其
许可人版权的任何其他行为。
16.1.4 如果客户在澳大利亚获得本软件，则即使本协议中有任何相反的规定，下列条款也适用：
澳大利亚消费者须知：
我们的商品包含澳大利亚消费者法规定的不能排除的担保。对于严重故障以及对任何其他可合理预
见的损失或损害的赔偿，您享有更换或退款的权利。此外，如果商品质量无法接受，但不存在严重
故障，您享有维修或更换商品的权利。按本协议规定，我们的软件产品还包含由Adobe Systems
Software Ireland Limited提供的90天有限担保，其办公地址为4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business
Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland。如果您的产品在您收到后90天内不能提供用户文档中所述的一般功
--- Page 25 ---
能，请致电1800 614 863与Adobe客户支持部门联系，并提供产品的详细信息、序列号和购买证
明。此时您可能需要将软件产品退回到我们提供的地址，在这种情况下，因退货产生的费用由您承
担。本担保规定的权益不包括您根据法律可以享有的其他权利和赔偿。
16.2 预发行版软件的附加条款。如果本软件是预发行版或试用版软件（“预发行版软件”），则本
条将适用。预发行版软件不代表Adobe提供的最终产品，并且可能含有缺陷、错误，以及可能造成
数据丢失、系统等方面出现故障的其他问题。Adobe从不以商业方式发布“预发行版软件”。如果
客户依据单独的书面协议（例如《Adobe Systems Incorporated 预发行软件许可协议》（Adobe
Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release Software））获得预发行版软件，则其
对软件的使用也受此类协议的约束。客户同意应Adobe要求或在Adobe以商业形式发布软件后（以
较早者为准）马上退回或销毁预发行版软件的所有副本。客户使用预发行版软件的风险由其自行承
担。有关预发行版软件的相关有限担保及责任限制，请参阅第6和第8条。
16.3 教育软件产品。如果本软件是教育软件产品（制造并分发以仅供教育最终用户(Educational End

助搜索以及产品欢迎页面。某些情况下，Adobe在线服务即使在网站上进行托管，但却可能是本软
件的特性或扩展。访问Adobe在线服务可能需要客户激活本软件、获取Adobe ID、接受附加使用
条款，或支付单独费用，以访问此类Adobe在线服务。Adobe在线服务可能不提供所有语言的版
本或向所有国家的居民推出，而且Adobe可随时基于任何原因修改或停止提供任何Adobe在线服
务。Adobe还保留对访问或使用以前免费提供的Adobe在线服务开始收费的权利。第14条阐述了
有关因特网连接和客户隐私的重要信息。按照第14条的规定，当本软件访问Adobe在线服务时，
客户对此类Adobe在线服务的使用受Adobe隐私政策（http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_cn）、
Adobe.com使用条款（http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_cn）和当时可能向客户呈现的附加使用
条款的约束。

本節條款中的任何規定與本協議的任何其他條款有任何衝突，則以本節條款為準。
16.1 無偏見；歐盟經濟區條款；澳洲規定公告。
16.1.1 本協議將不妨礙任何當事人，包括以消費者身份進行交易者應享有之法定權利。例如，若紐
西蘭消費者購得本軟體作個人使用、家用或內部使用（非商業用途），則本協議將受《消費者保證
法》(Consumer Guarantees Act)之約束。
16.1.2 如客戶是在歐盟經濟區(EEA)取得本軟體、常住於歐盟經濟區且身為消費者（亦即，客戶乃為
個人非商業性相關用途使用本軟體），則客戶針對本軟體的購買與使用不適用於第6節（有限保
證）之規定。反之，Adobe提供自軟體購買日起2年的保固期間，擔保本軟體用於相容電腦上時具
有適用使用手冊所載之功能（「協定功能」）。若實際功能與協定功能無顯著差異，則不構成得主
張保證服務之權利。本擔保不適用於客戶將軟體用來評估、試用、啟用或提供產品樣品等用途，亦
不適用於字型軟體，或是因客戶修改軟體而導致故障的情況。如要申請保證索賠，客戶須在2年保
證期間內通知Adobe客服部門，並提供購買本軟體的詳細證明文件。Adobe會向客戶查證本軟體是
否有瑕疵，或通知客戶該錯誤的發生是因為安裝本軟體的方式不正確（在這種情況下，Adobe會協

本協議（特別是此16.1.2節）內容主要載明客戶在使用本軟體發生問題時的權利（包括法定權
利）。如客戶的法定權利大於本節說明，則應以法定權利為準。
16.1.3 本協議中無任何條款（包括第4.4節），限制任何您在適用法律下可享有用來反編譯軟體的
非免除權利。例如，如果客戶居住於歐盟國家(EU)，客戶可能在適用法律指定的某些情況下，為獲
得軟體與其他軟體程式間的互通性，而有權對軟體進行必要的反編譯，前提是客戶已透過書面方式
要求Adobe提供達成此互通性的必要資訊，但Adobe並未提供此類資訊。除此之外，此類反編譯只
能由客戶，或其他代表客戶且有權使用軟體副本的人士執行。在提供此類資訊前，Adobe有權規定
合理條件。凡依本條款規定由Adobe提供或客戶取得的任何資訊僅限客戶用於本協議所述之用途，
不得向任何第三方披露，或用於製作與本軟體表述相類似之任何其他軟體，或用於任何其他違反
Adobe和其授權者著作權的行為。

2. Licence k programu; členství.
2.1 Licence k programu. Tento odstavec 2.1 platí pro Zákazníky, kteří zakoupili licenci k Programu, ale
nezakoupili licenci na základě členství ani žádnou členskou službu, například Creative Cloud (jak se
uvádí v odstavci 2.2).
2.1.1 Udělení licence. Za podmínky, že Zákazník bude neustále dodržovat tuto smlouvu a zaplatí
příslušné licenční poplatky, uděluje Adobe Zákazníkovi nevýhradní a omezenou licenci k instalaci a
používání Programu (a) na území či v regionu, kde zákazník získá Program od Adobe nebo
autorizovaného prodejce Adobe nebo jinak v souladu s Dokumentací („Území“), (b) během období
trvání takové licence („Licenční období“), (c) v rozsahu typu Licence a na Povoleném počtu
Kompatibilních počítačů Zákazníka, jak je uvedeno v Dokumentaci, a (d) způsobem odpovídajícím
podmínkám této smlouvy a příslušné Dokumentace. Licenční období je neomezené, pokud není
uvedeno jinak v této smlouvě, příslušné Dokumentaci či v době nákupu. Po uplynutí či ukončení
Licenčního období mohou některé Programy či všechny Programy bez dalšího předchozího oznámení
přestat fungovat. Po uplynutí či ukončení Licenčního období nesmí Zákazník Program používat, pokud
licenci neprodlouží. Zde udělenou licenci doplňují specifická ustanovení článku 16, která se týkají použití
určitých produktů a komponent, které mohou být součástí Programu, například programy typů písma,
Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite a
moduly Runtime Adobe.
2.1.2 Typy licence.
2.1.2.1 Program bez sériového čísla. Poskytuje-li se Program nebo jeho části během Licenčního období
bez sériového čísla, je možné je instalovat a používat na jakémkoli počtu Kompatibilních počítačů v
rámci plánu nasazení v organizaci během Licenčního období, pouze však pro účely předvádění,
hodnocení a školení a dále pouze tehdy, když se Výstupní soubory či jiné materiály, k jejichž vytvoření
takové používání vede, používají pouze pro interní, nekomerční a neprodukční účely. PROGRAM BEZ
SÉRIOVÉHO ČÍSLA SE POSKYTUJE „TAK, JAK JE“. PŘÍSTUP K VÝSTUPNÍM SOUBORŮM A JAKÉKOLI
POUŽITÍ VÝSTUPNÍCH SOUBORŮ VYTVOŘENÝCH TAKOVÝM PROGRAMEM BEZ SÉRIOVÉHO ČÍSLA
JSOU ZCELA NA VLASTNÍ RIZIKO ZÁKAZNÍKA.
2.1.2.2 Program pro vyhodnocení. Program nebo části Programu poskytované se sériovým číslem
určené pro „účely vyhodnocení“ nebo s jiným obdobným označením (například Program s označením
skladové jednotky „EVAL“ dodaný na základě samostatné smlouvy) (dále „Program pro vyhodnocení“),
je možné instalovat a používat na jakémkoli Povoleném počtu Kompatibilních počítačů, pouze však pro
účely předvádění, vyhodnocování a školení a pouze tehdy, když jakékoli Výstupní soubory či jiné
materiály vytvořené takovým využitím slouží pouze pro interní, nekomerční a neprodukční účely.
PROGRAM PRO VYHODNOCENÍ SE POSKYTUJE „TAK, JAK JE“. PŘÍSTUP K VÝSTUPNÍM SOUBORŮM A
JAKÉKOLI POUŽITÍ VÝSTUPNÍCH SOUBORŮ VYTVOŘENÝCH TAKOVÝM PROGRAMEM PRO
VYHODNOCENÍ JSOU ZCELA NA VLASTNÍ RIZIKO ZÁKAZNÍKA.
2.1.2.3 Verze na bázi předplatného. Pokud má Zákazník zakoupenou licenci Programu na bázi
předplatného („Verze na bázi předplatného“), může instalovat a používat Verzi na bázi předplatného
během Licenčního období na Povoleném počtu Kompatibilních počítačů. Při dodržení podmínky
--- Page 45 ---
Povoleného počtu Počítačů pro Verzi na bázi předplatného může Adobe umožnit Zákazníkovi během
Licenčního období na stejném Počítači instalovat a používat poslední předchozí verzi Programu ve Verzi
na bázi předplatného a aktuální verzi Programu ve Verzi na bázi předplatného. Zákazník souhlasí, že
Adobe může kdykoli změnit typ Programu (například konkrétní komponenty, verze, platformy, jazyky
apod.) zahrnuté do Verze na bázi předplatného a že takovou změnou nevznikne společnosti Adobe ve
vztahu k Zákazníkovi žádná odpovědnost. Průběžný přístup k Verzi na bázi předplatného vyžaduje:
(a) opakované připojení k internetu za účelem aktivace, obnovení a ověření licence, (b) opakované
obdržení plateb předplatného společností Adobe nebo autorizovaným prodejcem a (c) souhlas
Zákazníka s podmínkami předplatného a s dalšími podmínkami, které jsou k dispozici na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_cz nebo v době nákupu. Pokud Adobe neobdrží
opakovanou platbu předplatného nebo nemůže pravidelně ověřit licenci, může Program přestat
fungovat bez dalšího oznámení, a to až do doby, kdy Adobe obdrží platbu nebo ověří licenci.
2.1.3 Užití na přenosném nebo domácím Počítači. S výhradou ustanovení uvedených v odstavci 2.1.4
je hlavní uživatel Počítače, na kterém je Program podle odstavce 2.1 nainstalován („Primární
uživatel“), oprávněn nainstalovat druhou kopii Programu (výhradně pro osobní potřebu) na
přenosný počítač nebo na počítač umístěný doma za předpokladu, že Program na přenosném nebo
domácím počítači není užíván ve stejnou dobu jako na hlavním Počítači.
2.1.4 Omezení sekundárního užívání držiteli množstevních licencí. Pokud Program pořídil v rámci
programu množstevních licencí Adobe nebo takové smlouvy (například na základě množstevní licence
Adobe) držitel licence jiné než množstevní licence pro uživatele ve školství, může se druhá kopie
Programu pořízená podle odstavce 2.1.3 používat výhradně pro potřebu a ve prospěch daného držitele
množstevní licence.
2.1.5 Platforma umožňující dvojí spouštění. Licence na Program se vztahuje na použití na specifické
platformě operačního systému. Zákazník si musí zakoupit samostatné licence pro použití Programu na
každé platformě operačního systému. Pokud si například Zákazník přeje instalovat Program pro
platformy operačního systému Mac OS i Windows na zařízení, které používá obě tyto platformy (tj. na
počítači s dvojím spouštěním), musí si nejprve k Programu pořídit dvě samostatné licence. Toto platí i
v případě, jestliže se obě verze Programu, byť je každá určena pro jinou platformu operačního systému,
dodávají Zákazníkovi na stejném médiu.
2.1.6 Distribuce ze serveru. Pokud to povoluje Dokumentace, může Zákazník nakopírovat obraz
Programu na souborový server Zákazníka v interní síti Zákazníka („Server“) pro účely stahování a
instalace Programu na Počítače v téže interní síti za účelem použití povoleného v tomto článku 2.
2.1.7 Užívání serverů.
2.1.7.1 V souladu s podmínkami samostatného kupního dokumentu nebo Dokumentace a s výhradou
omezení licence uvedených v této smlouvě může Zákazník instalovat Program na serveru pouze pro
účely umožnění přístupu k Programu a jeho používání uživateli z Počítačů ve stejné Interní síti („Uživatel
sítě“). Uživatel sítě, který má přístup k takovému Programu ze Serveru, se dále označuje „Uživatel
Programu ze Serveru“. Celkový počet Uživatelů Programu ze Serveru (nikoli počet uživatelů
používajících Program současně) nesmí překročit Povolený počet. Pokud například Zákazník
zakoupil 10 licencí Programu (Povolený počet činí 10) a rozhodne se instalovat Program na Serveru,
může umožnit přístup k Programu pouze maximálně 10 Uživatelům Programu ze Serveru (byť může mít
Zákazník více než 10 Uživatelů sítě nebo méně než 10 uživatelů, kteří používají Program současně).
2.1.7.2 Pro objasnění a bez omezení lze uvést, že na základě výše uvedených podmínek nemá Zákazník
oprávnění Program instalovat ani k němu přistupovat přímo nebo prostřednictvím příkazů, dat či
pokynů: (a) zadávaných z Počítače nebo do Počítače, který není součástí Interní sítě Zákazníka,
(b) umožňujících přístup k pracovním skupinám nebo službám na internetu, (c) uživatele, který není
oprávněn na základě platné licence Adobe tuto kopii Programu užívat, (d) jež jsou součástí systému,
pracovního postupu nebo služeb přístupných více uživatelům, než je Povolený počet uživatelů,
(e) v případě procesů, které nespustil jeden uživatel (např. automatické serverové zpracování údajů).

2.2 Členství. Tento odstavec 2.2 se týká Zákazníků, kteří zakoupili licenci nebo službu na bázi členství,
například členství ve službě Creative Cloud (souhrnně dále „Členství“).
2.2.1 On-line služby Adobe týkající se Členství. Za podmínky, že bude Zákazník neustále dodržovat tuto
smlouvu a zaplatí případné příslušné členské poplatky, uděluje Adobe Zákazníkovi na celém Území
nevýhradní a omezené právo přístupu k Programu a k souvisejícím On-line službám Adobe (jak se dále
popisuje v odstavci 16.4.1) a jejich používání, a to v rámci Členství, s výhradou podmínek uvedených v
této smlouvě a Dalších podmínkách použití (jak je tento výraz definován v odstavci 14.1.3 níže).
2.2.2 Licence k Programu související s Členstvím. Za podmínky, že bude Zákazník neustále dodržovat
tuto smlouvu a zaplatí případné příslušné členské poplatky, uděluje Adobe Zákazníkovi nevýhradní a
omezenou licenci na instalaci a používání Programu: (a) na Území, (b) během období, kdy je Členství
platné a aktivní („Období členství“) a (c) způsobem odpovídajícím podmínkám této smlouvy a příslušné
Dokumentace. Po uplynutí nebo ukončení Období členství (x) může některý Program nebo všechny
Programy přestat fungovat, a to bez dalšího předchozího oznámení, a (y) Zákazník nesmí Program
používat, pokud si neprodlouží členství. Všechny podmínky týkající se konkrétního Programu uvedené v
této Smlouvě jsou i nadále účinné a platí ve vztahu k Zákazníkovi a jeho užívání Programu.
2.2.3 Omezení. Zákazník souhlasí s následujícími doplňujícími podmínkami a omezeními týkajícími se
Členství: (a) Adobe může změnit typ Programu (například konkrétní výrobky, komponenty, verze,
platformy, jazyky apod.) zahrnuté do Členství a takovou změnou nevznikne společnosti Adobe ve
vztahu k Zákazníkovi žádná odpovědnost, (b) může být také nutné, aby se Zákazník kdykoli během
Období členství připojil k internetu a přihlásil se, (c) Program se může kdykoli automaticky připojovat k
internetu za účelem ověření Členství zákazníka, a to bez dalšího oznámení, (d) Zákazník nesmí umožnit
ani povolit jiným osobám používat Program jako Zákazník.
2.3 Soubory. Není-li uvedeno jinak v souborech „Read-Me“, v Dokumentaci nebo v jiné licenci či jiných
licencích připojených k Souborům, může Zákazník tyto Soubory používat, zobrazovat, upravovat,
reprodukovat a rozšiřovat. Zákazník však není oprávněn Soubory samostatně rozšiřovat (tedy tak, aby
Soubory tvořily hlavní hodnotu rozšiřovaného produktu) a práva k ochranným známkám náležející k
Souborům nebo k dílům z nich odvozených není Zákazník oprávněn uplatňovat. Nic, co je zde uvedeno,
nemá dopad na vlastnictví Programu, jak se uvádí v článku 3.
2.4 Vzorový aplikační kód. Ve zdrojovém kódu může Zákazník modifikovat ty části vybavení Programu,
které jsou v průvodní Dokumentaci výslovně označeny jako vzorový kód, vzorový aplikační kód,
fragmenty kódu, soubory třídy ActionScript nebo vzorové komponenty (všechny uvedené komponenty
dále jen „Vzorový aplikační kód“), a to výhradně pro účely navrhování, vývoje a testování internetových
stránek a aplikací vyvinutých pomocí programového vybavení Adobe a za předpokladu, že má Zákazník
oprávnění kopírovat a distribuovat Vzorový aplikační kód (modifikovaný či nemodifikovaný), a to pouze
v případě, že jsou splněny všechny následující podmínky: (a) Zákazník distribuuje se svou aplikací
Vzorový aplikační kód pouze v kompilované verzi v objektovém kódu, (b) Zákazník nezahrnuje Vzorový
aplikační kód do žádného produktu ani aplikace určené pro vývoj internetových stránek, (c) Zákazník
nepoužívá při prodeji své aplikace název Adobe, logo či ikony Adobe ani jiné ochranné známky Adobe.
Zákazník se zavazuje odškodnit společnost Adobe a zprostit ji odpovědnosti za všechny případné ztráty,
škody, nároky či soudní spory včetně právních poplatků, které by vznikly z používání či distribuce
aplikace Zákazníka.
2.5 Programovací jazyky. Program může obsahovat části sad nástrojů ExtendScript SDK a Pixel Bender
SDK. S výhradou omezení obsažených v tomto článku 2 společnost Adobe Zákazníkovi uděluje
nevýhradní, nepřevoditelnou a bezplatnou licenci k použití součástí sad ExtendScript SDK a Pixel Bender
SDK výhradně pro účely interního vývoje aplikačních programů určených pro spolupráci s produkty
Adobe. S výjimkou případů výslovně uvedených v tomto odstavci 2.5 nesmí Zákazník žádné části sad
ExtendScript SDK a Pixel Bender SDK upravovat ani distribuovat. Zákazník se zavazuje odškodnit
společnost Adobe a zprostit ji odpovědnosti za všechny případné ztráty, škody, nároky či soudní spory,
včetně právních poplatků, které by vznikly z takovéto distribuce.
--- Page 47 ---
2.6 Kopie Dokumentace. Pro vlastní interní použití v souvislosti s využíváním Programu v souladu
s touto smlouvou si může Zákazník pořizovat kopie Dokumentace, nikoli však v množství větším než
nezbytně nutném.
3. Práva duševního vlastnictví.
Program a všechny povolené kopie, které Zákazník vytvoří, jsou duševním vlastnictvím společnosti
Adobe Systems Incorporated a jejích dodavatelů. Struktura, organizace a kód Programu představují
cenné obchodní tajemství a utajované skutečnosti společnosti Adobe Systems Incorporated a jejích
dodavatelů. Program je chráněn zákony – zejména zákony na ochranu autorských práv Spojených států
amerických a dalších zemí – a ustanoveními mezinárodních smluv. S výjimkou případů, kdy se zde
výslovně uvádí jinak, tato smlouva Zákazníkovi neuděluje žádná práva duševního vlastnictví ve vztahu k
Programu. Veškerá práva, která nejsou výslovně udělena, si vyhrazuje společnost Adobe a její
dodavatelé.
4. Omezení a požadavky.
4.1 Oznámení o vlastnictví. Všechny povolené kopie Programu (včetně mj. Dokumentace), které
Zákazník vytvoří, musí obsahovat stejná upozornění na autorská práva a ostatní informace o vlastnictví,
které jsou uvedeny v tomto Programu.
4.2 Povinnosti týkající se používání. Zákazník souhlasí, že nebude používat Program způsobem jiným,
než jaký povoluje tato smlouva, a že nebude Program používat způsobem, který není v souladu s jeho
návrhem či Dokumentací.
4.3 Zákaz úprav. S výjimkou případů výslovně uvedených v článku 2 nebo 16 není Zákazník oprávněn
upravovat, portovat, přizpůsobovat nebo lokalizovat tento Program.
4.4 Zákaz zpětného inženýrství. S výjimkou případů, kdy se v odstavci 16.1 uvádí jinak, Zákazník nesmí
provádět zpětný překlad, zpětné dešifrování, rozklad ani jiné pokusy o zjištění zdrojového kódu
Programu.
4.5 Nedělitelnost. Program může obsahovat různé aplikace a komponenty, může umožňovat přístup k
různým On-line službám Adobe, může podporovat více platforem a jazyků a může být Zákazníkovi
dodáván na jednom nebo několika médiích či ve více kopiích. Přesto je však Program určen a
poskytován Zákazníkovi jako jediný produkt, který má být používán jako jediný produkt na Počítačích,
jak je povoleno v této smlouvě. Pokud Dokumentace nepovoluje jinak, Zákazník nemusí instalovat
všechny komponenty Programu, ale nesmí oddělovat komponenty Programu pro účely použití na
jiných Počítačích.
4.6 Nepřevoditelnost.
4.6.1 ZÁKAZNÍK NENÍ OPRÁVNĚN PRONAJÍMAT, NAJÍMAT, PRODÁVAT, UDĚLOVAT PODŘÍZENÉ
LICENCE, POSTUPOVAT ANI PŘEVÁDĚT SVÁ PRÁVA K TOMUTO PROGRAMU (VČETNĚ MJ.
PROGRAMU ZÍSKANÉHO STAŽENÍM Z INTERNETU) ANI POVOLOVAT KOPÍROVÁNÍ JAKÉKOLI ČÁSTI
TOHOTO PROGRAMU DO POČÍTAČE JINÉ FYZICKÉ NEBO PRÁVNICKÉ OSOBY, S VÝJIMKOU PŘÍPADŮ

informace o převodu programů získaných v rámci množstevních licencí jsou k dispozici na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_cz.
4.6.3 Pokud Program vyžaduje opakovanou aktivaci nebo registraci a Adobe svým rozhodnutím zprostí
Zákazníka povinnosti takové opakované aktivace či registrace, pak navíc k omezením stanoveným v
Podmínkách aktivace (jak jsou definovány v odstavci 14.3) s takovým zproštěním okamžitě pozbývá
platnosti právo Zákazníka provést trvalý převod, jak se uvádí v odstavci 4.6.2.
4.7 Zákaz obslužného střediska. Zákazník není oprávněn používat ani nabízet Program prostřednictvím
obslužného střediska. Odstavec 16.6.3 obsahuje pouze omezenou výjimku týkající se programu typů
písma.
4.8 Omezení pro moduly Adobe Runtime. Žádné moduly Adobe Runtime nesmí Zákazník používat na
jiném zařízení než na Počítači ani na zařízení s jakýmkoli včleněným operačním systémem nebo jeho
verzí pro takové zařízení. Aby nedošlo k pochybnostem, Zákazník nesmí žádný modul Runtime Adobe
Používat například v (a) mobilních zařízeních, set top boxech, kapesních počítačích, telefonech, herních
konzolích, televizorech, přehrávačích DVD, mediálních centrech (kromě Windows XP Media Center
Edition a jeho nástupců), elektronických billboardech či jiných digitálních vývěskách, internetových
zařízeních či jiných zařízeních připojených na internet, zařízeních PDA, zdravotnických zařízeních,
bankomatech, telematických zařízeních, herních přístrojích, systémech domácí automatizace, kioscích,
zařízeních dálkového ovládání či jakýchkoli jiných zařízeních spotřební elektroniky, (b) mobilních,
kabelových, satelitních či televizních systémech provozovaných operátorem nebo (c) jiných zařízeních
s uzavřeným systémem. Další informace o licencích na moduly Adobe Runtime jsou k dispozici na
adrese http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_cz.
4.9 Území. Zákazník smí používat Program a využívat přístup k On-line službám Adobe pouze na Území
a způsobem vyhovujícím zásadám pro aktivaci popsaným na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_cz. Pokud Adobe usoudí, že Zákazník používá Program nebo On-
line služby Adobe mimo Území, může ukončit platnost licence poskytnuté touto smlouvou nebo
pozastavit členství či přístup k On-line službám Adobe.
5. Aktualizace.
Pokud je Program Aktualizací předchozí verze programu Adobe („Předchozí verze“), smí Zákazník
takovou Aktualizaci používat za podmínky, že si ponechá Předchozí verzi. Pokud tedy podle
odstavce 4.6 Zákazník provede převod takové Aktualizace, musí s ní převést i Předchozí verzi. Pokud si
Zákazník přeje používat tuto Aktualizaci navíc k Předchozí verzi, může tak činit pouze na stejném
Počítači, na kterém Zákazník instaloval a používá Předchozí verzi. Jakékoli závazky podpory Předchozí
verze, které společnost Adobe může mít během Licenčního období, mohou být v okamžiku
zpřístupnění této Aktualizace ukončeny. Není povoleno žádné jiné použití této Aktualizace. Další
Aktualizace může Adobe poskytovat Zákazníkovi na základě licence obsahující doplňující nebo odlišné
podmínky.
6. Omezená záruka.
S výhradou ustanovení specifické smlouvy uzavřené společností Adobe a nabyvatelem licence k
Programu společnost Adobe ručí fyzické či právnické osobě, která zakoupila jako první licenci k
Programu za účelem použití odpovídajícího této smlouvě, že bude Program fungovat v zásadě v
souladu s odpovídající uživatelskou příručkou k Programu, a to buď po dobu (a) devadesáti (90) dnů,
nebo (b) po Licenční období, podle toho, která z těchto lhůt je kratší, od okamžiku obdržení Programu
(„Záruční doba“) při použití na Kompatibilním počítači. Nepodstatné odchylky funkce od uživatelské
příručky nezakládají právo na reklamaci. Tato omezená záruka se nevztahuje na následující položky,
--- Page 49 ---
které jsou poskytovány „tak, jak jsou“, bez jakékoli záruky společnosti Adobe: (i) opravy, (ii) programy
typu písma, (iii) Beta verze programu, zkušební, testovací nebo startovací verze, demo verze, vzorky
produktu, Program pro vyhodnocení nebo neprodejné kopie Programu, (iv) internetové stránky, On-
line služby Adobe, On-line služby třetích stran, (v) Služby certifikace dokumentů (viz článek 16), a
(vi) programy poskytované společností Adobe zdarma stažením z internetových stránek Adobe.
Všechny reklamace musejí být uplatňovány s dokladem o koupi na Oddělení péče o zákazníky během
Záruční doby. Další informace o záručních reklamacích jsou k dispozici na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/support_cz. Veškeré ručení společnosti Adobe a jejích přidružených
společností ve vztahu k záruční reklamaci a výhradní a jediný nápravný prostředek pro Zákazníka v
rámci jakékoli záruky se omezuje dle rozhodnutí Adobe buď na podporu Programu na základě záruční
reklamace, výměnu Programu, nebo, pokud by podpora ani výměna nebyla podle společnosti Adobe
vhodná, na vrácení (případného) licenčního poplatku zaplaceného Zákazníkem za takový Program. NA

odpovědnost společnosti Adobe, ve vztahu k Zákazníkovi, v případě smrti nebo úrazu v důsledku
opomenutí Adobe nebo záměrného uvedení v omyl (podvodu). Společnost Adobe jedná ve jménu
svých přidružených společností, dodavatelů a certifikačních úřadů z důvodů zřeknutí se, vyloučení a
omezení závazků, záruk a odpovědností, avšak v žádném dalším ohledu ani z žádného jiného důvodu.

9. Pravidla pro vývoz.
Zákazník bere na vědomí, že Program podléhá zákonům USA o kontrole vývozu („Exportní zákony“) a
tyto Exportní zákony bude dodržovat. Zákazník nesmí Program vyvážet ani reexportovat, přímo ani
nepřímo: (a) do zemí, které podléhají omezením uvaleným v USA na vývoz (tyto země zahrnují Kubu,
Írán, Severní Koreu, Súdán a Sýrii, omezení se ale mohou týkat i jiných zemí), (b) koncovému uživateli, o
němž Zákazník ví nebo má důvod se domnívat, že je využívá ke konstrukci, vývoji či výrobě nukleárních,
chemických či biologických zbraní nebo raketových systémů, vesmírných nosičů či sondážních raket,
případně nepilotovaných vzdušných systémů, nebo (c) koncovému uživateli, kterému bylo jakýmkoli
federálním úřadem nebo vládou USA zakázáno účastnit se vývozních transakcí z USA. Navíc Zákazník
zodpovídá za dodržení jakýchkoli místních zákonů platných v jurisdikci Zákazníka, které mohou mít
dopad na jeho práva v oblasti importu, exportu a používání Programu. Pokud se společnost Adobe
dozví, že došlo k porušení těchto ustanovení, může pro ni být nemožné poskytovat údržbu a podporu
pro Program.
10. Rozhodné právo.
Pokud Program Zákazník používá jako spotřebitel pouze pro osobní nekomerční účely, řídí se tato
smlouva zákony jurisdikce, v níž Zákazník licenci k používání Programu zakoupil. Pokud Zákazník není
takový spotřebitel, smlouva se řídí platným právem (a byla sestavena v souladu s ním): (a) státu
Kalifornie, pokud se v okamžiku získání licence k Programu Zákazník nachází ve Spojených státech,
Kanadě či Mexiku, nebo (b) Japonska, pokud se v okamžiku získání licence k Programu Zákazník
nachází v Japonsku, nebo (c) Singapuru, pokud se v okamžiku získání licence k Programu Zákazník
nachází v členském státu Sdružení národů jihovýchodní Asie (ASEAN), kontinentální Číně, zvláštních
správních regionech Hongkong a Macao, Tchaj-wanu nebo v Korejské republice, nebo (d) Anglie,
pokud se v okamžiku získání licence k Programu Zákazník nachází v jakékoli jiné jurisdikci, než se uvádí
výše. Příslušné soudy v obvodu Santa Clara v Kalifornii, platí-li právo státu Kalifornie, okresní soud v
Tokiu v Japonsku, platí-li japonské právo, a příslušné soudy v Londýně v Anglii, platí-li anglické a
waleské právo, mají nevýlučnou soudní pravomoc v souvislosti se všemi spory týkajícími se této
smlouvy. Pokud platí singapurské právo, bude jakýkoli spor vyplývající z této smlouvy nebo vzniklý
v souvislosti s ní, včetně jakýchkoli otázek ohledně její existence, platnosti či ukončení platnosti, řešen a
s konečnou platností rozhodnut rozhodčím řízením v Singapuru, v souladu s pravidly pro vedení
rozhodčích řízení Singapurského mezinárodního rozhodčího střediska (Singapore International
Arbitration Centre, „SIAC“), jak budou v danou dobu v platnosti, přičemž taková pravidla se považují za
odkazem včleněná do tohoto oddílu. Rozhodovat bude jeden rozhodce, kterého vyberou strany
společně. Nebude-li rozhodce vybrán do třiceti (30) dnů, poté co jedna strana předloží písemný
požadavek na postoupení sporu do rozhodčího řízení, provede výběr předseda SIAC. Jazykem
rozhodčího řízení bude angličtina. Bez ohledu na jakákoli ustanovení této smlouvy může společnost
Adobe či Zákazník požádat jakýkoli soudní, správní či jiný orgán, aby nařídil jakékoli dočasné či
ochranné opatření, včetně soudního příkazu, konkrétního plnění či jiného spravedlivého opatření, jak
před zahájením soudního či arbitrážního řízení, tak během něj, a to za účelem ochrany práv a zájmů či
--- Page 51 ---
za účelem vynucení specifických podmínek, které jsou vhodné pro dočasné opatření. Tato smlouva se
neřídí (x) kolizními normami žádné jurisdikce, (y) Vídeňskou úmluvou OSN o mezinárodní koupi zboží
ani (z) zákonem UCITA (Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act), v podobě přijaté v jakékoli
jurisdikci, a jejich aplikace je tímto výslovně vyloučena.
11. Všeobecná ustanovení.
Pokud se kterákoli část této smlouvy stane neplatnou a nevynutitelnou, nijak to neovlivní platnost
zbylých ustanovení smlouvy, která zůstávají i nadále platná a vynutitelná v souladu s jejími podmínkami.
Tato smlouva může být změněna pouze písemně a musí ji podepsat oprávněný zástupce společnosti
Adobe. Při výkladu této smlouvy je rozhodující verzí verze anglická. Toto je úplné ujednání mezi
Zákazníkem a Adobe týkající se Programu a nahrazuje všechna předchozí vyjádření, jednání, opatření a
reklamní prohlášení týkající se tohoto Programu.
12. Poznámka pro koncové uživatele ze skupiny vládních institucí USA.
12.1 Vládní licence USA na Adobe Technology. Zákazník souhlasí s tím, že při poskytování licence na
program Adobe pro vládní instituce USA nebo dodavatele těchto institucí, bude Zákazník postupovat v
souladu s opatřeními uvedenými v 48 CFR, oddíl 12.212 (pro administrativně správní agentury) a 48
CFR, oddíl 227.7202–1 a 227.7202–4 (pro Ministerstvo obrany). Pro koncové uživatele ze skupiny
vládních institucí USA Adobe prohlašuje, že dodržuje všechny platné zákony, včetně ustanovení
prováděcího příkazu 11246 v platném znění, oddílu 402 zákona na podporu veteránů vietnamské války
z roku 1974 (38 USC 4212) a oddílu 503 zákona proti diskriminaci z roku 1973 v platném znění a
vyhlášky 41 CFR, oddíl 60–1 až 60–60, 60–250 a 60–741. Ustanovení a články týkající se afirmativní akce
uvedené v předchozí větě jsou v této smlouvě uvedeny odkazem.
12.2 Komerční položky. V případě koncových uživatelů z řad vlády USA představuje tento Program a
jeho Dokumentace „Komerční položky“ ve smyslu definice v 48 CFR, oddíl 2.101, zahrnující „Komerční
software k počítači“ a „Dokumentaci ke komerčnímu softwaru k počítači“ ve smyslu použití těchto
pojmů v 48 CFR, oddíl 12.212 nebo 48 CFR, oddíl 227.7202. V souladu s 48 CFR, oddíl 12.212 nebo 48
CFR, oddíl 227.7202–1 až 227.7202-4 byly tento Komerční software k počítači a Dokumentace ke
komerčnímu softwaru k počítači licencovány k používání koncovými uživateli ze skupiny vládních
institucí USA (a) pouze jako Komerční položka a (b) pouze v rozsahu práv, která jsou podle podmínek
zde uvedených udělena všem ostatním koncovým uživatelům. Nepublikovaná práva jsou vyhrazena
podle zákona na ochranu autorských práv Spojených států.
13. Shoda s licencemi.
Je-li Zákazníkem podnik, společnost či organizace, souhlasí s tím, že kromě kontroly dodržování
licenčních podmínek prováděné Programem mají společnost Adobe nebo její autorizovaný zástupce
právo na základě kontroly záznamů, systémů a zařízení Zákazníka, na kterou bude upozorněn sedm (7)
dnů předem a která může proběhnout nejvýše jednou za dvanáct (12) měsíců, ověřit, zda je používání
veškerého softwaru společnosti Adobe v souladu s platnými licencemi této společnosti. Adobe má
například právo na takové záznamy Zákazníka, jež jsou užitečné pro určení, zda Zákazník instalace
Programu provedl se sériovým číslem. Zákazník je povinen společnosti Adobe takové záznamy na
základě její žádosti bezodkladně poskytnout. Dále Zákazník poskytne společnosti Adobe všechny
záznamy a informace, o které Adobe požádá za účelem ověření, že použití Programu Adobe
Zákazníkem je v souladu s platnými licencemi poskytnutými společností Adobe, a to do třiceti (30) dnů
od podání požadavku společností Adobe. Další informace o serializaci jsou k dispozici na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_cz.
--- Page 52 ---
14. Připojení k internetu a ochrana osobních údajů.
14.1 Automatické připojení k internetu. Program může způsobit, že se Počítač Zákazníka bude, bez
dalšího oznámení, automaticky připojovat k internetu a komunikovat s internetovými stránkami či
doménou společnosti Adobe, mj. pro účely ověření licence a poskytnutí dalších informací, vlastností a
funkcí Zákazníkovi. Není-li v Odstavcích 14.2 až 14.7 uvedeno jinak, platí pro veškeré automatické
připojování Programu k internetu následující ustanovení:
14.1.1 Kdykoli program uskuteční připojení k internetu a komunikuje s internetovými stránkami Adobe,
platí – ať již automaticky nebo na základě výslovného požadavku uživatele – Zásady ochrany soukromí.
Zásady ochrany soukromí Adobe umožňují sledovat návštěvy na internetových stránkách a zabývají se
podrobněji problematikou sledování a používání „cookies“, funkčních odkazů a podobných zařízení.
14.1.2 Kdykoli se Program připojí k Adobe přes internet, určité informace jsou shromažďovány a
přenášeny Programem společnosti Adobe, v souladu se Zásadami ochrany soukromí Adobe, které jsou
k dispozici na adrese http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_cz („Zásady ochrany soukromí“).
14.1.3 Pokud Zákazník přistupuje k On-line službám Adobe (jak jsou definovány v odstavci 16.4 níže)
nebo Program aktivuje či registruje, mohou být přenášeny a společností Adobe uloženy další informace,
například Adobe ID Zákazníka, jeho uživatelské jméno a heslo, a to v souladu se Zásadami ochrany
soukromí a s dalšími podmínkami použití týkajícími se On-line služeb Adobe (spolu s Podmínkami
použití Adobe.com a dalšími platnými podmínkami „Další podmínky použití“).
14.1.4 V souladu s tím, jak to povoluje místní právo či jak s tím souhlasí Zákazník, může Adobe
(a) posílat Zákazníkovi transakční zprávy pro usnadnění On-line služeb Adobe nebo aktivace či
registrace Programu či On-line služeb Adobe nebo (b) dodat marketingová sdělení začleněná do
produktu za účelem poskytnutí informací o Programu a dalších produktech a službách Adobe s využitím
informací mj. ohledně verze platformy, verze Programu, stavu licence a jazyka.
14.2 Aktualizace. Program může způsobit, že se Počítač Zákazníka bude, bez dalšího oznámení,
automaticky připojovat k internetu (občas nebo pravidelně) za účelem (a) kontroly Aktualizací, které
jsou k dispozici ke stažení a k instalaci do Počítače Zákazníka, a (b) informování společnosti Adobe o
výsledcích pokusů o instalaci.
14.3 Aktivace. Program může vyžadovat, aby si Zákazník (a) opatřil Adobe ID, (b) aby aktivoval nebo
znovu aktivoval Program, (c) aby Program registroval nebo (d) aby potvrdil Členství. Takový požadavek
může způsobit, že se Počítač Zákazníka připojí k internetu bez dalšího oznámení, a to při instalaci,
spuštění nebo pravidelně poté. Jakmile je Program připojen, bude shromažďovat a přenášet společnosti
Adobe informace blíže popsané na adrese http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_cz („Podmínky
aktivace“). Program nebo Zákazník mohou také od Adobe obdržet informace týkající se licence
Zákazníka, jeho předplatného či členství. Adobe může takové informace využívat v zájmu detekce či
předcházení podvodnému nebo neoprávněnému užívání v rozporu s platnou licencí, předplatným či
členstvím. Pokud Zákazník Program neaktivuje, neregistruje, nepotvrdí předplatné či Členství nebo
pokud Adobe určí, že dochází k podvodnému či neoprávněnému užívání Programu, může dojít k úbytku
funkcí, nefunkčnosti Programu nebo k ukončení či pozastavení předplatného či Členství.
14.4 Deaktivace. Zákazník může deaktivovat nebo odinstalovat Program ze svého Počítače za účelem
instalace a aktivace Programu na jiném Počítači v souladu s touto smlouvou („Deaktivace“), jak se dále
popisuje na adrese http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_cz. Deaktivace vyžaduje připojení k internetu.
14.5 Použití On-line služeb. Program může způsobit, že se Počítač Zákazníka bude, bez dalšího
oznámení, občas nebo pravidelně automaticky připojovat k internetu, aby umožnil Zákazníkovi přístup
k obsahu a službám poskytovaným společností Adobe nebo třetími stranami, jak je dále popsáno
v odstavci 16.4 (On-line služby). Navíc se může Program, bez dalšího oznámení, automaticky připojovat
k internetu za účelem aktualizace materiálů, které lze z těchto On-line služeb stahovat, aby měl
Zákazník tyto služby k okamžité dispozici, i když právě není připojen.
--- Page 53 ---
14.6 Digitální certifikáty. Program používá digitální certifikáty (jak jsou popsány v odstavci 16.5), které
pomáhají Zákazníkovi identifikovat stažené soubory (např. aplikace nebo obsah) a jejich vydavatele.
Například aplikace Adobe AIR používá digitální certifikáty, aby usnadnila Zákazníkovi identifikaci
vydavatele aplikací Adobe AIR. Řada produktů Adobe Acrobat také používá digitální certifikáty za
účelem podpisu a jeho ověření v dokumentech formátu přenosného dokumentu (Portable Document
Format, PDF) a k ověření certifikovaných dokumentů PDF. V průběhu ověřování digitálního certifikátu
může dojít k připojení Počítače Zákazníka k internetu.
14.7 Manažer nastavení. Program může obsahovat aplikaci Flash Player. Aplikace Flash Player může
ukládat určitá uživatelská nastavení v Počítači Zákazníka jako místní sdílený objekt. Tyto objekty jsou
přiřazeny aplikaci Flash Player na Počítači a umožňují Zákazníkovi funkce modulu runtime uživatelsky
upravovat. Správce nastavení aplikace Flash Player umožňuje taková nastavení měnit, včetně možnosti
omezovat možnost třetích stran ukládat místní sdílené objekty či udělit obsahu třetí strany právo
přístupu k mikrofonu a kameře Počítače. Další informace o tom, jak konfigurovat nastavení v
Zákazníkově verzi programu Flash Player, včetně informací o tom, jak zakázat místní sdílené objekty
ve správci nastavení programu Flash Player, naleznete na adrese
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_cz. Další informace o místních sdílených objektech jsou k
dispozici na adrese http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_cz.
15. Komunikace na rovnocenné úrovni.
Program může bez dalšího oznámení použít připojení Zákazníka k místní síti LAN pro automatické
připojení k jiným programům Adobe a při tom může na místní síti LAN signalizovat, že je k dispozici pro
účely komunikace s jinými programy Adobe. Tato připojení mohou přenášet adresu IP Zákazníkova
připojení k místní síti.
16. Specifická ustanovení a výjimky.
Tento článek stanovuje zvláštní ustanovení vztahující se ke konkrétním produktům a součástem
Programu a výjimky z konkrétních ujednání a podmínek. V případě jakéhokoli rozporu mezi
ustanoveními tohoto článku a podmínkami této smlouvy jsou rozhodující ustanovení tohoto článku.
16.1 Žádná práva nejsou dotčena, ustanovení týkající se Evropského hospodářského prostoru, povinné
oznámení týkající se Austrálie.
16.1.1 Zákonná práva žádné strany, včetně spotřebitele, nejsou touto smlouvou dotčena. Například pro
spotřebitele z Nového Zélandu, kteří tento Program získají k osobnímu, soukromému používání nebo
k používání v domácnosti (nevýdělečné účely), podléhá tato smlouva zákonu o ochraně spotřebitele.
16.1.2 Pokud Zákazník Program získal v Evropském hospodářském prostoru (EHP), má obvykle
bydliště v EHP a je spotřebitel (to znamená, že Program používá pro osobní nekomerční účely), tento
článek 6 se na jeho koupi a použití Programu nevztahuje. Místo toho společnost Adobe poskytuje
záruku po dobu 2 let od koupě, že bude Program vykonávat funkce uvedené v příslušné uživatelské
příručce („Sjednané funkce“), pokud bude používán na Kompatibilním počítači. Nepodstatná
odchylka od Sjednaných funkcí nezakládá právo na reklamaci. TATO ZÁRUKA SE NEVZTAHUJE NA
PROGRAM, KTERÝ ZÁKAZNÍK POUŽÍVÁ JAKO BETA VERZI, ZKUŠEBNÍ NEBO STARTOVACÍ VERZI ČI
VZOREK PRODUKTU, ANI NA PROGRAMY TYPŮ PÍSMA ANI NA PŘÍPADY, KDY PROGRAM
NEFUNGUJE, PROTOŽE HO ZÁKAZNÍK POZMĚNIL. Chce-li Zákazník Program reklamovat, musí
během této dvouleté záruční doby uvědomit Oddělení péče o zákazníky a poskytnout podrobnosti
ohledně dokladu o koupi Programu. Společnost Adobe ve spolupráci se Zákazníkem ověří, zda došlo
k závadě v Programu, nebo oznámí, že chyba vyplývá z nesprávné instalace Programu (v takovém
případě společnost Adobe Zákazníkovi poskytne asistenci). Pokud se bude jednat o závadu
Programu, může Zákazník společnost Adobe požádat buď o vrácení peněz, nebo o opravenou či
vyměněnou kopii Programu. K žádosti musí Zákazník přiložit doklad o koupi. V případě, že bude
Zákazníkova záruční reklamace opodstatněná, splní společnost Adobe požadavek Zákazníka na
--- Page 54 ---
poskytnutí opraveného či vyměněného Programu. Pokud by to však bylo pro společnost Adobe
nerozumné, může Zákazníkovi vrátit peníze. Pomoc týkající se záruky získáte ve Středisku zákaznické
podpory společnosti Adobe.
Pamatujte prosím na to, že ustanovení článku 8 (Omezení odpovědnosti) se i nadále vztahují
k jakýmkoli nárokům na odškodnění, jež může Zákazník uplatnit ve vztahu k používání Programu.
Společnost Adobe nicméně odpovídá za přímé ztráty, které jsou rozumně předvídatelné, jestliže by
došlo k porušení této smlouvy ze strany společnosti Adobe. Doporučujeme Zákazníkovi přijmout
veškerá rozumná opatření umožňující vyhnout se škodám nebo je zmírnit, konkrétně pořizováním
záložních kopií Programu a počítačových dat.
Tato smlouva, zejména v tomto odstavci 16.1.2, si klade za cíl popsat práva Zákazníka (včetně
zákonných práv) v případě, že by došlo k problémům s používáním Programu Zákazníkem. Pokud jsou
zákonná práva Zákazníka větší, než jak je zde popsáno, platí zákonná práva Zákazníka.
16.1.3 Nic, co tato smlouva obsahuje (včetně odstavce 4.4), nemůže omezit žádná práva na
dekompilování Programu, jichž se nemůže Zákazník vzdát a jež mohou Zákazníkovi ze zákona náležet.
Pokud například Zákazník pobývá v Evropské unii (EU), může mít právo za určitých podmínek
specifikovaných v platných zákonech dekompilovat Program, pokud je to nezbytné za účelem dosažení
interoperability Programu s jiným softwarovým programem a pokud Zákazník nejprve požádal Adobe o
poskytnutí informací nezbytných pro dosažení takové operability, avšak společnost Adobe takové
informace neposkytla. Navíc takovou dekompilaci může provádět pouze Zákazník nebo někdo jiný, kdo
je oprávněn používat kopii Programu jménem Zákazníka. Společnost Adobe má právo před
poskytnutím takových informací stanovit přiměřené podmínky. Jakékoli informace dodané společností
Adobe nebo získané Zákazníkem způsobem zde uváděným může používat pouze Zákazník a pro účely
zde popsané a nesmí je sdělit žádné třetí straně ani použít pro vytvoření programu, který je v zásadě
podobný formě Programu, ani je nesmí použít pro žádné jiné činy, které porušují autorská práva
společnosti Adobe a jejích poskytovatelů licencí.
16.1.4 Pokud zákazník získá Program v Austrálii, platí následující ustanovení, a to bez ohledu na to, zda
tato smlouva uvádí jinde jinak:
OZNÁMENÍ PRO SPOTŘEBITELE V AUSTRÁLII:
Naše zboží se dodává se zárukami, které není možné podle australského spotřebitelského zákona
vyloučit. V případě velké závady máte nárok na výměnu výrobku nebo náhradu kupní ceny a na
náhradu jakékoli jiné rozumně předvídatelné ztráty či škody. Máte také nárok nechat si zboží opravit
nebo vyměnit, pokud kvalita zboží není přijatelná a závada nepředstavuje velkou závadu. Naše
softwarové výrobky se také dodávají s devadesátidenní omezenou zárukou, kterou poskytuje
společnost Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited se sídlem na adrese 4–6 Riverwalk, Citywest
Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irsko, jak se uvádí v této smlouvě. Pokud vaše výrobky nemají všeobecné
vlastnosti a funkce popsané v uživatelské Dokumentace během devadesátidenního období od dodání,
kontaktujte Oddělení zákaznické podpory společnosti Adobe na čísle 1800 614 863. Mějte při sobě
informace o výrobku, sériové číslo a doklad o nákupu. Může být nutné, abyste softwarový výrobek

Výhody plynoucí z této záruky jsou poskytovány nad rámec jiných práv a nápravných opatření, které
vám mohou plynout ze zákona.
16.2 Dodatečná ustanovení pro beta verzi Programu. Tento článek platí, jedná-li se o demo nebo beta
verzi (dále jen „Beta verze programu“). Beta verze Programu nepředstavuje konečný produkt
společnosti Adobe a může obsahovat chyby a jiné problémy, které mohou způsobit zhroucení
systému nebo jiné selhání a ztrátu dat. Beta verze Programu Adobe není určena k prodeji. Program
podléhá samostatné písemné smlouvě, jako je např. Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement
for Pre-Release Software (standardní smlouva společnosti Adobe k programům, které nejsou určeny
k prodeji), a používání Programu Zákazníkem se takovou smlouvou rovněž řídí. Na žádost Adobe
nebo při uvedení takového Programu Adobe na trh, podle toho, co nastane dříve, Zákazník
bezodkladně vrátí nebo zničí všechny kopie Beta verze Programu. BETA VERZI PROGRAMU POUŽÍVÁ

16.3 Vzdělávací program. Je-li program tzv. „Educational Software Product“ (Program vyrobený
a distribuovaný pouze pro Koncové uživatele ve školství), není Zákazník oprávněn Program používat,
pokud ve smyslu své jurisdikce nepatří mezi Koncové uživatele ve školství. Na adrese

16.4 On-line služby.
16.4.1 Poskytované společností Adobe. Program usnadňuje Zákazníkovi přístup k obsahu a různým
službám poskytovaným na webových stránkách provozovaných společností Adobe nebo jejími

jiné: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com,
Search for Help a uvítací obrazovky jednotlivých produktů. V některých případech se může On-line
služba Adobe jevit jako vlastnost nebo rozšíření v rámci Programu, byť je poskytována z webových
stránek. Přístup k On-line službám Adobe může vyžadovat, aby Zákazník aktivoval Program, získal
Adobe ID, souhlasil s Dalšími podmínkami použití nebo může vyžadovat zaplacení samostatného
poplatku za účelem přístupu k On-line službám Adobe. On-line služby Adobe nemusejí být dostupné ve
všech jazycích a pro obyvatele všech zemí. Společnost Adobe může kdykoli a z jakéhokoli důvodu
upravit On-line služby Adobe nebo ukončit jejich dostupnost. Společnost Adobe si rovněž vyhrazuje
právo zpoplatnit přístup k On-line službě Adobe či použití On-line služby Adobe, jež byla dříve nabízena
bezplatně. Článek 14 uvádí důležité informace týkající se připojení k internetu a ochrany soukromí
Zákazníka. Jak bylo uvedeno v článku 14, platí, že když Program přistoupí k On-line službám Adobe, řídí
se používání takových On-line služeb Adobe Zákazníkem Zásadami ochrany soukromí společnosti
Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_cz), Podmínkami použití stránek Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_cz) a dalšími podmínkami použití, které mohou být Zákazníkovi
v danou dobu předloženy.
16.4.2 Poskytované třetími stranami. Program může Zákazníkovi usnadnit přístup k webovým stránkám
provozovaným třetími stranami, které nabízejí zboží, informace, programy a služby („On-line služby
třetích stran“). Mezi takové On-line služby třetích stran patří mimo jiné služba Kodak EasyShare Gallery.
Přístup a použití jakýchkoli takových On-line služeb třetích stran Zákazníkem se řídí podmínkami,
vyloučením odpovědnosti a upozorněními, jež se na takové stránce nacházejí nebo jsou s těmito On-
line službami třetích stran jinak spojeny. Společnost Adobe On-line služby třetích stran nekontroluje,
nedoporučuje ani za ně nepřijímá odpovědnost. Jakákoli jednání mezi Zákazníkem a jakoukoli třetí
stranou ve spojitosti s On-line službou třetí strany, včetně zásad ochrany soukromí a použití osobních
informací, doručování zboží a poskytování služeb a plateb za ně, a jakákoli další ujednání, podmínky,
záruky nebo prohlášení spojená s takovými jednáními jsou vedena výhradně mezi Zákazníkem a
takovou třetí stranou. On-line služby třetích stran nemusejí být dostupné ve všech jazycích a pro
obyvatele všech zemí. Společnost Adobe může kdykoli a z jakéhokoli důvodu upravit On-line služby
třetích stran nebo ukončit jejich dostupnost.
16.4.3 S VÝJIMKOU PŘÍPADŮ VÝSLOVNĚ SCHVÁLENÝCH SPOLEČNOSTÍ ADOBE, JEJÍMI
PŘIDRUŽENÝMI SPOLEČNOSTMI NEBO TŘETÍ STRANOU V SAMOSTATNÉ SMLOUVĚ POUŽÍVÁ

příslušný certifikační úřad poskytuje své služby, včetně například ujednání o předplatném, souhlasu
smluvních stran, prohlášení o zásadách certifikace a bezpečnosti. Více informací o prodejcích služeb

externími problémy, může zobrazovat, že je podpis platný, přestože digitální certifikát mohl být zrušen
nebo jeho platnost mohla před okamžikem ověření již skončit, (b) k narušení bezpečnosti a integrity
digitálního certifikátu může dojít z důvodu nějaké činnosti či opomenutí podepsané osoby tohoto
certifikátu, příslušného Certifikačního úřadu nebo jiné třetí strany a (c) certifikát může být certifikátem
podepsatelným sebou samým, který neposkytuje Certifikační úřad. ZA ROZHODOVÁNÍ O

jakékoli výstupní zařízení připojené k takovému Počítači.
16.6.2 Je-li Povolený počet Počítačů pět (5) či méně, může Zákazník program typů písma uložit do

tohoto zvláštního programu typů písma platnou licenci.
16.6.4 Za účelem vytištění, zobrazení či úprav dokumentu může Zákazník kopie programu typů písma
vložit do svých elektronických dokumentů. Žádná další práva na vkládání programu typů písma nejsou

s jistými prvky pomocí digitálního oprávnění v rámci Programu („Klíč“). Zákazník se zavazuje, že se ke
Klíči nepřipojí, ani se k němu nepokusí připojit a ani se ho za žádným účelem nepokusí řídit, vyřadit
z provozu, používat nebo rozšiřovat.
16.8.3 U všech unikátních Rozšířených dokumentů může Zákazník pouze buď (a) Rozšiřovat tento

opdateringer og tilføjelser til sådan information, leveret til kunden af Adobe på et hvilket som helst
tidspunkt, i det omfang sådan information ikke er leveret i henhold til en separat aftale (herefter under
ét ”Opdateringer”).
2. Softwarelicens; Medlemskab.
2.1 Softwarelicens. Afsnit 2.1 gælder kunder, der har købt en licens til softwaren, men som ikke har købt
en medlemskabsbaseret licens eller tjeneste, såsom Creative Cloud-medlemskabet (som beskrevet i
afsnit 2.2).
2.1.1 Licenstildeling. I henhold til kundens fortsatte overholdelse af denne aftale og betaling af de
gældende licensafgifter tildeler Adobe kunden en ikke-eksklusiv og begrænset licens til at installere og
bruge softwaren (a) i de territorier eller det område, hvor kunden erhverver softwaren fra Adobe eller
Adobes autoriserede forhandler eller som angivet i øvrigt i dokumentationen (”Territorium”), (b) i
perioden for en sådan licens (”Licensperiode”), (c) inden for omfanget af licenstypen og på det tilladte
antal af kundens kompatible computere som angivet i dokumentationen samt (d) på en måde, som er i
overensstemmelse med vilkårene for denne aftale og den gældende dokumentation. Medmindre andet
er defineret i denne aftale, i den gældende dokumentation eller på købstidspunktet, er licensperioden
uendelig. Ved udløb eller ophør af licensperioden ophører dele af eller al softwaren muligvis med at
fungere uden forudgående varsel. Ved udløb eller ophør af licensperioden må kunden ikke bruge
softwaren, medmindre kunden har fornyet licensen. Den heri tildelte licens suppleres af specifikke
bestemmelser i afsnit 16 i forhold til brugen af bestemte relevante produkter og komponenter, der
følger med softwaren, såsom fontsoftware, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash
Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite og Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 Licenstyper.
2.1.2.1 Software uden serienummer. Softwaren eller dele af softwaren, som er leveret uden
serienummer i løbet af licensperioden, må kun installeres og bruges på et antal kompatible computere
som del af en udrulningsplan i en organisation i løbet af licensperioden til demonstrations-, evaluerings-
og træningsformål, og kun hvis eventuelle outputfiler eller andre materialer, som produceres i
forbindelse med denne anvendelse udelukkende anvendes til interne, ikke-kommercielle og ikke-
produktionsrelaterede formål. SOFTWAREN UDEN SERIENUMMER LEVERES ”SOM DEN ER”. ADGANG
TIL OG BRUG AF OUTPUTFILER, SOM ER OPRETTET VED HJÆLP AF SOFTWARE UDEN SERIENUMMER,
SKER HELT PÅ KUNDENS EGET ANSVAR.
2.1.2.2 Evalueringssoftware. Softwaren eller dele af softwaren, som er leveret med et serienummer
angivet med ”evalueringsformål” eller anden lignende angivelse (såsom software eller et serienummer
leveret som ”EVAL” i henhold til en særskilt aftale) (”evalueringssoftware”) må kun installeres og
anvendes på et tilladt antal kompatible computere i løbet af licensperioden til demonstrations-,
evaluerings- og træningsformål, og kun hvis eventuelle outputfiler eller andet materiale, som
produceres i forbindelse med denne anvendelse, udelukkende anvendes til interne, ikke-kommercielle
og ikke-produktionsrelaterede formål. EVALUERINGSSOFTWAREN LEVERES ”SOM DEN ER”. ADGANG
TIL OG BRUG AF OUTPUTFILER, SOM ER OPRETTET VED HJÆLP AF EVALUERINGSSOFTWARE, SKER
HELT PÅ KUNDENS EGET ANSVAR.
--- Page 62 ---
2.1.2.3 Abonnementsudgave. Hvad angår den software, der er tilgængelig på abonnementsbasis
(”Abonnementsudgave”), må kunden kun installere og bruge abonnementsudgaven på det tilladte antal
kompatible computere i løbet af licensperioden. I henhold til det tilladte antal computere til
abonnementsudgaven kan Adobe give kunden tilladelse til at installere og bruge den seneste tidligere
version af abonnementsudgaven og den aktuelle version af abonnementsudgaven på den samme
computer i løbet af licensperioden. Kunden accepterer, at Adobe til enhver tid må ændre den
softwaretype (såsom specifikke komponenter, versioner, platforme, sprog osv.), der følger med
abonnementsudgaven, og ikke på nogen måde er ansvarlig over for kunden for sådanne ændringer.
Vedvarende adgang til en abonnementsudgave kræver: (a) en fast internetforbindelse til at aktivere,
forny og validere licensen, (b) Adobes eller den autoriserede forhandlers kvittering for faste
abonnementsbetalinger og (c) kundens accept af abonnementets vilkår og andre tilgængelige vilkår og
betingelser, som findes på http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_dk eller på købstidspunktet. Hvis
Adobe ikke modtager betaling for det faste abonnement eller ikke kan validere licensen regelmæssigt,
kan softwaren blive inaktiv uden forudgående varsel, indtil Adobe modtager betalingen eller validerer
licensen.
2.1.3 Brug på bærbare computere eller hjemmecomputere. Med forbehold for de i afsnit 2.1.4
anførte begrænsninger må den primære bruger af den computer, som softwaren er installeret på
under afsnit 2.1 (”Primær bruger”), installere yderligere én kopi af softwaren udelukkende til sin
egen brug, enten på en bærbar computer eller på en computer, der befinder sig i hans eller hendes
hjem, forudsat at softwaren på den bærbare computer eller hjemmecomputeren ikke anvendes
samtidig med, at softwaren anvendes på den primære computer.
2.1.4 Begrænsninger i volumenlicenstagerens sekundære brug. Såfremt softwaren blev anskaffet under
et Adobe-volumenlicensprogram eller en Adobe-volumenlicensaftale (såsom Adobe Volume Licensing)
af en anden licenstager end en indehaver af en undervisningsvolumenlicens, må den sekundære kopi af
softwaren, der er fremstillet i henhold til afsnit 2.1.3, kun benyttes til fordel for og i forretningsøjemed af
volumenlicenstageren.
2.1.5 Dual Boot-platform. Der gives licens til brug af softwaren på en specifik operativsystemplatform.
Kunden skal købe en separat licens til brug af softwaren på hver operativsystemplatform. Hvis kunden
f.eks. ønsker at installere softwaren på både Mac OS- og Windows-operativsystemplatform på en enhed,
der kører begge disse platforme (dvs. en dual boot-maskine), skal kunden først indhente to separate
licenser til softwaren. Dette gælder, selvom to versioner af softwaren, hver designet til en anden
operativsystemplatform, leveres til kunden på samme medie.
2.1.6 Distribution fra en server. Som tilladt ifølge dokumentationen må kunden overføre en kopi af
softwaren til en filserver i kundens interne netværk (”Server”) med det formål at downloade og
installere softwaren på computere i det samme interne netværk til brug udelukkende som tilladt ifølge
afsnit 2.
2.1.7 Serverbrug.
2.1.7.1 Som tilladt ifølge et separat købsdokument eller dokumentationen og i henhold til
licensbegrænsninger i denne aftale må kunden kun installere softwaren på en server med det formål at
tillade en person på en computer i samme interne netværk (”Netværksbruger”) at få adgang til og bruge
softwaren. Den netværksbruger, der har adgang til denne type software på serveren, omtales som
”Serversoftwarebruger”. Det samlede antal serversoftwarebrugere (ikke det samtidige antal brugere) må
ikke overskride det tilladte antal. Eksempel: Hvis kunden har købt 10 softwarelicenser (tilladte antal
er 10), og denne vælger at installere softwaren på en server, kan kunden kun give op til 10
serversoftwarebrugere tilladelse til adgang til softwaren (selvom kunden har mere end 10
netværksbrugere eller færre end 10 samtidige brugere af softwaren).
2.1.7.2 Som eksempel og uden begrænsning giver ovenstående ikke kunden lov til at installere eller få
adgang til softwaren (enten direkte eller via kommandoer, data eller instruktioner): (a) fra eller til en
computer, der ikke indgår i kundens interne netværk, (b) til at aktivere webhostede arbejdsgrupper eller
offentligt tilgængelige webhostede tjenester, (c) for personer eller kollektive enheder til at bruge,
--- Page 63 ---
downloade, kopiere eller på anden vis drage fordel af softwarens funktionalitet, medmindre de har
licens dertil fra Adobe, (d) som komponent i et system, en arbejdsgang eller en tjeneste, der er
tilgængelig for flere end det tilladte antal brugere, eller (e) til opgaver, der ikke initieres af en individuel
bruger (f.eks. automatisk serverbehandling).
2.2 Medlemskab. Dette afsnit 2.2 gælder kunder, som har købt en medlemskabsbaseret licens eller
tjeneste, såsom Creative Cloud-medlemskab (samlet kaldet ”Medlemskab”).
2.2.1 Adobe online-tjenester i relation til medlemskabet. Under forudsætning af kundens fortsatte
overholdelse af denne aftale og betaling af de gældende medlemskabsafgifter tildeler Adobe kunden en
ikke-eksklusiv og begrænset ret, der gælder i hele territoriet, til adgang til og brug af softwaren og den
relaterede Adobe online-tjeneste (som yderligere beskrevet i afsnit 16.4.1) som en del af medlemskabet
i henhold til vilkårene anført i denne aftale samt yderligere vilkår for brug (sådan som begrebet er
defineret i afsnit 14.1.3 herunder).
2.2.2 Softwarelicens i relation til medlemskabet. Under forudsætning af kundens fortsatte overholdelse
af denne aftale og betaling af de gældende medlemskabsafgifter giver Adobe kunden en ikke-eksklusiv
og begrænset licens til at installere og bruge softwaren: (a) i territoriet, (b) i den periode, dette
medlemskab gælder og er aktivt (”Medlemskabsperiode”) og (c) på en måde, der er i
overensstemmelse med vilkårene for denne aftale og den gældende dokumentation. Ved udløb eller
ophør af medlemskabsperioden, (x) ophører dele af eller al softwaren muligvis med at fungere uden
forudgående varsel, og (y) kunden må ikke bruge softwaren, medmindre kunden har fornyet
medlemskabet. Alle vilkår for den specifikke software som anført i denne aftale er fortsat gyldige og
gælder forsat kunden og dennes brug af en sådan software.
2.2.3 Begrænsninger. Kunden accepterer følgende yderligere vilkår og begrænsninger for
medlemskabet: (a) Adobe må til enhver tid ændre den softwaretype (såsom specifikke produkter,
komponenter, versioner, platform, sprog osv.), der følger med medlemskabet, og er ikke på nogen
måde ansvarlig over for kunden for sådanne ændringer; (b) kunden kan være nødt til at oprette
forbindelse til internettet og logge på et hvilket som helst tidspunkt i løbet af medlemskabsperioden;
(c) softwaren kan automatisk oprette forbindelse til internettet for at kontrollere kundens medlemskab
til enhver tid og uden varsel og (d) kunden må ikke sætte andre i stand til eller tillade andre at bruge
softwaren som kunde.
2.3 Indholdsfiler. Medmindre andet er anført i ”Readme”-filerne, dokumentationen eller andre licenser,
der vedrører indholdsfilerne, må kunden bruge, vise, ændre, reproducere og distribuere alle
indholdsfilerne. Kunden må dog ikke distribuere indholdsfilerne på enkeltstående basis, dvs. under
forhold, hvor indholdsfilerne udgør den primære værdi i det produkt, der distribueres, og kunden er
ikke berettiget til at gøre krav gældende vedrørende varemærkerettigheder til indholdsfiler eller til
værker, der skabes på grundlag deraf. Intet anført heri påvirker ejerskabet af softwaren som anført i
afsnit 3.
2.4 Applikationskodeeksempler. Kunden kan ændre kildekodeformen for de dele af
softwareprogrammerne, der udtrykkeligt er identificeret som kodeeksempler,
applikationskodeeksempler, kodestykker, ActionScript-klassefiler eller eksempelkomponenter (alle
kaldet ”applikationskodeeksempler”) i den medfølgende dokumentation udelukkende med det formål
at designe, udvikle og teste websteder og applikationer, der er udviklet ved brug af Adobe-
softwareprogrammer, dog således at kunden alene må kopiere og distribuere
applikationskodeeksemplerne (ændret eller uændret), såfremt alle følgende betingelser er opfyldt:
(a) Kunden distribuerer kun de kompilerede objekt-kodeversioner af applikationskodeeksemplerne
sammen med sin applikation; (b) kunden inkluderer ikke applikationskodeeksemplerne i et produkt
eller en applikation, der er beregnet til udvikling af websteder; og (c) kunden benytter ikke Adobes
navn, logoer eller andre af Adobes varemærker til at markedsføre sin applikation. Kunden er indforstået
med at holde Adobe skadesløs og beskytte og forsvare Adobe mod alle tab, skader, krav eller
sagsanlæg, herunder advokatsalærer, der opstår som følge af brug eller distribution af sin applikation.
--- Page 64 ---
2.5 Programmeringssprog. Softwaren kan inkludere dele af ExtendScript SDK og Pixel Bender SDK. Med
forbehold af begrænsningerne i nærværende afsnit 2 tildeler Adobe kunden en ikke-eksklusiv, ikke-
overdragelig, royalty-fri licens til at benytte elementerne i ExtendScript SDK og Pixel Bender SDK
udelukkende til intern udvikling af brugerprogrammer, der er beregnede til at fungere sammen med
Adobe-produkter. Medmindre det udtrykkeligt er angivet i afsnit 2.5, må ingen dele af ExtendScript SDK
eller Pixel Bender SDK ændres eller distribueres. Kunden accepterer at holde Adobe skadesløs for alle
tab, skader, krav eller sagsanlæg, herunder advokatsalærer, der opstår som følge af en sådan
distribution.
2.6 Dokumentationskopier. Kunden må fremstille kopier af dokumentationen til egen intern brug i
forbindelse med benyttelse af softwaren i overensstemmelse med denne aftale, men ikke flere end det
antal, der med rimelighed kan anses for at være nødvendigt.
3. Ejendomsretten til immaterielle rettigheder.
De immaterielle rettigheder til softwaren og til enhver autoriseret kopi fremstillet af kunden, tilhører og
ejes af Adobe Systems Incorporated og selskabets leverandører. Softwarens struktur, opbygning og
kildekode er værdifulde forretningshemmeligheder og fortrolige oplysninger, som tilhører Adobe
Systems Incorporated og selskabets leverandører. Softwaren er beskyttet af lov, herunder men ikke
begrænset til den i USA og andre lande gældende lovgivning om ophavsret samt internationale
konventionsbestemmelser. Medmindre det er udtrykkeligt anført heri, tildeler denne aftale ikke kunden
nogen immaterielle rettigheder til softwaren. Alle rettigheder, der ikke udtrykkeligt tildeles, er
forbeholdt Adobe og Adobes leverandører.
4. Begrænsninger og krav.
4.1 Oplysninger om ejendomsret. Enhver tilladt kopi af softwaren (herunder uden begrænsning
dokumentationen), som kunden fremstiller, skal indeholde de samme meddelelser om ophavsret og
ejendomsret, som fremgår af eller i softwaren.
4.2 Brugsforpligtelser. Kunden accepterer, at han eller hun ikke vil bruge softwaren til andet end det, der
er tilladt ifølge denne aftale, og at han eller hun ikke vil bruge softwaren på en måde, der ikke er i
overensstemmelse med dens design og dokumentation.
4.3 Ingen ændringer. Bortset fra, hvad der er tilladt i medfør af afsnit 2 eller 16, må kunden ikke ændre,
overføre, tilpasse eller oversætte softwaren.
4.4 Ingen reverse engineering. Bortset fra, hvad der ellers er tilladt i afsnit 16.1, må kunden ikke
dekompilere, foretage reverse engineering, demontere eller på anden vis forsøge at afsløre softwarens
kildekode.
4.5 Ingen ”unbundling”. Softwaren indeholder muligvis forskellige applikationer og komponenter,
tillader muligvis adgang til forskellige Adobe online-tjenester, understøtter muligvis flere platforme og
sprog og leveres muligvis til kunden på flere medier eller i flere eksemplarer. Ikke desto mindre er
softwaren udviklet og leveret til kunden som et enkelt produkt, der er beregnet til brug som et enkelt
produkt på computere, som tilladt heri. Medmindre det på anden måde tillades i dokumentationen,
behøver kunden ikke at installere alle komponenterne i softwaren, men kunden må ikke adskille
softwarens komponenter til brug på forskellige computere.
4.6 Ingen overdragelse.
4.6.1 KUNDEN ER IKKE BERETTIGET TIL AT UDLEJE, BORTLEASE, SÆLGE, VIDERELICENSERE, TILDELE
ELLER OVERDRAGE SINE RETTIGHEDER TIL SOFTWAREN (HERUNDER UDEN BEGRÆNSNING
SOFTWARE, DER ER ERHVERVET VED DOWNLOAD FRA ET WEBSTED) ELLER TIL AT TILLADE, AT EN
DEL AF SOFTWAREN KOPIERES TIL ANDRE PERSONERS ELLER JURIDISKE ENHEDERS COMPUTERE,
UNDTAGEN I DET OMFANG DET MÅTTE VÆRE UDTRYKKELIGT TILLADT EFTER DENNE AFTALE.
--- Page 65 ---
4.6.2 Med undtagelse af undervisningssoftware (som defineret i afsnit 16.3), ”pre-release”-software (som
defineret i afsnit 16.2), evalueringssoftware, ”not-for-resale”-kopier af softwaren eller software, der er
erhvervet gennem et Adobe-volumenlicensprogram og yderligere i henhold til afsnit 4.6.3 må kunden
permanent overføre alle sine rettigheder til brug af softwaren til en anden person eller juridisk enhed
under forudsætning af, at: (a) kunden også overdrager (i) denne aftale, (ii) serienumrene, softwaren på
medier fra Adobe eller Adobes autoriserede distributør og al anden software eller hardware, der er
bundtet, pakket eller præinstalleret med softwaren, herunder alle kopier, opdateringer og tidligere
versioner (som defineret i afsnit 5 nedenfor), og (iii) alle kopier af fontsoftware til denne person eller
kollektive enhed; (b) kunden ikke beholder opdateringer, tidligere versioner eller kopier, herunder
sikkerhedskopier og kopier lagret på en computer; og (c) modtageren accepterer denne aftales vilkår
og betingelser og alle øvrige vilkår og betingelser, som var gældende for kundens køb af en gyldig
licens til softwaren. Der er flere oplysninger om overdragelse af volumenlicenssoftware på
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_dk.
4.6.3 Hvis softwaren kræver tilbagevendende aktivering eller registrering, og Adobe imødekommer
kundens anmodning om at blive undtaget fra kravet om en sådan tilbagevendende aktivering eller
registrering, vil retten til permanent at overdrage licensen som anført i afsnit 4.6.2 ophøre omgående
efter imødekommelsen af en sådan anmodning. Dette gælder i tillæg til begrænsningerne anført i
vilkårene for aktivering (som defineret i afsnit 14.3)
4.7 Ikke servicebureauer. Kunden vil ikke bruge eller udbyde softwaren som et servicebureau. I
afsnit 16.6.3 tilvejebringes en begrænset undtagelse udelukkende for fontsoftware.
4.8 Begrænsninger vedrørende Adobe Runtime. Kunden må ikke bruge Adobe Runtime på en anden
enhed end en personlig computer eller med en integreret eller enhedsversion af et operativsystem.
Kunden må for eksempel ikke bruge Adobe Runtimes på en (a) mobil enhed, set-top-boks, håndholdt
enhed, telefon, spilkonsol, tv, dvd-afspiller, mediecenter (dog ikke Windows XP Media Center Edition og
senere versioner), elektronisk opslagstavle eller andre former for digitale skilte, internetudstyr eller
andet udstyr med internetadgang, PDA, medicinsk udstyr, betalingsautomat, telematisk udstyr,
spilmaskine, system til automatisering af hjemmet, kiosk, fjernbetjeningsenhed eller anden elektronisk
enhed, (b) operatørbaseret mobiltelefon, kabel, satellit eller tv-system eller (c) en anden enhed i et
lukket system. Der er flere oplysninger om licens til Adobe Runtimes på
http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_dk.
4.9 Territorium. Kunden vil kun bruge softwaren og besøge Adobe online-tjenester i territoriet og på en
måde, der stemmer overens med den aktiveringspolitik, der er beskrevet på
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_dk. Adobe kan ophæve den licens, der gives heri, eller ophæve
medlemskabet eller adgang til Adobe online-tjenester, hvis Adobe mener, at kunden bruger softwaren
eller Adobe online-tjenester uden for territoriet.
5. Opdateringer.
Hvis softwaren er en opdatering af en tidligere version af Adobe-software (”Tidligere version”), er
kundens brug af denne opdatering betinget af, at kunden bevarer den tidligere version. Hvis kunden
derfor gyldigt overdrager denne opdatering i medfør af afsnit 4.6, skal kunden overdrage den tidligere
version sammen med den. Hvis kunden ønsker at anvende denne opdatering ud over den tidligere
version, må kunden kun gøre dette på den samme computer, hvor han eller hun har installeret og
anvender den tidligere version. Enhver forpligtelse, som Adobe måtte have til at understøtte tidligere
versioner i løbet af licensperioden, kan ophøre ved denne opdaterings tilgængelighed. Ingen anden
anvendelse af opdateringen er tilladt. Yderligere opdateringer kan gives i licens fra Adobe med
yderligere eller ændrede vilkår.
--- Page 66 ---
6. Begrænset garanti.
Medmindre det er anført på anden måde i en separat aftale mellem Adobe og en softwarelicenstager,
garanterer Adobe over for den person eller den juridiske enhed, der først køber en licens til softwaren til
brug i overensstemmelse med vilkårene i denne aftale, at softwaren i al væsentlighed vil fungere i
overensstemmelse med den tilhørende brugerhåndbog til softwaren, når den bruges på den kompatible
computer, i den korteste periode af følgende: (a) en periode på halvfems (90) dage eller
(b) licensperioden efter modtagelse af softwaren (”Garantiperioden”). Ikke-væsentlige udsving i
softwarens funktionalitet i forhold til brugerhåndbogen udgør ikke grundlag for et garantikrav. Denne
begrænsede garanti gælder ikke for følgende, som er gjort tilgængelige SOM DE ER OG FOREFINDES og
uden garanti fra Adobe: (i) programrettelser, (ii) fontsoftware, (iii) pre-release-software, prøvekopier,
startpakker, evaluering, produktprøver, evalueringssoftware og ”not-for-resale”-kopier (NFR) af
softwaren, (iv) hjemmesider, Adobe online-tjenester, tredjeparts online-tjenester, (v) Certified
Document Services (se afsnit 16) og (vi) enhver software, der er gjort gratis tilgængelig af Adobe via
download fra en Adobe hjemmeside. Alle garantikrav skal gøres gældende over for Adobes
kundeserviceafdeling inden for en sådan garantiperiode sammen med gyldig kvittering for købet. Der er
flere oplysninger om garantikrav på http://www.adobe.com/go/support_dk. Adobes og dets tilknyttede
selskabers eneste forpligtelse i forhold til et sådant garantikrav og kundens eneste
misligholdelsesbeføjelse under en hvilken som helst garanti er begrænset til, efter Adobes eget valg,
enten support på softwaren baseret på garantikravet, ombytning af softwaren eller, hvis support eller
ombytning efter Adobes skøn ikke er mulig, tilbagebetaling af den licensafgift (om nogen), kunden har
betalt for softwaren. DEN BEGRÆNSEDE GARANTI, DER ER ANFØRT I DETTE AFSNIT, GIVER KUNDEN
BESTEMTE JURIDISKE RETTIGHEDER. KUNDEN KAN HAVE ANDRE RETTIGHEDER I HENHOLD TIL
LOVGIVNINGEN, OG DISSE KAN VÆRE FORSKELLIGE FRA RETSOMRÅDE TIL RETSOMRÅDE. ADOBE
FORSØGER IKKE AT BEGRÆNSE KUNDENS GARANTIRETTIGHEDER PÅ NOGEN MÅDE, DER IKKE ER
TILLADT IFØLGE LOVGIVNINGEN. Læs afsnit 16 for at få retsområdespecifikke oplysninger, eller kontakt
Adobes kundeserviceafdeling.
7. Ansvarsfraskrivelse.
DEN I AFSNIT 6 FREMSATTE BEGRÆNSEDE GARANTI OG ENHVER LOVBESTEMT GARANTI OG
MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSE, DER IKKE KAN FRAVIGES ELLER BEGRÆNSES EFTER GÆLDENDE LOV,
ER DE ENESTE GARANTIER OG ENESTE MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSER, SOM ER GÆLDENDE FOR
SOFTWAREN. BORTSET FRA DE GIVNE OG LOVBESTEMTE GARANTIER OG
MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSER AFVISER ADOBE, DETS TILKNYTTEDE SELSKABER, LEVERANDØRER
OG CERTIFIKATUDSTEDENDE MYNDIGHEDER (DEFINERET NEDENFOR) ALLE UDTRYKKELIGE ELLER
UNDERFORSTÅEDE GARANTIER, BETINGELSER, ERKLÆRINGER ELLER VILKÅR UDEN HENSYN TIL
LOVGIVNING, SÆDVANERET, KUTYME, SKIK OG BRUG ELLER ANDET VEDRØRENDE NOGET
FORHOLD, HERUNDER, MEN IKKE BEGRÆNSET TIL, YDELSE, SIKKERHED, IKKE-INDGREB I
TREDJEPARTS RETTIGHEDER, INTEGRERING, SALGBARHED, UFORSTYRRET ANVENDELSE,
TILFREDSSTILLENDE KVALITET OG EGNETHED TIL ET BESTEMT FORMÅL. BORTSET FRA SÅDANNE
GIVNE OG LOVBESTEMTE GARANTIER OG MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSER LEVERES SOFTWAREN OG
ADGANG TIL ENHVER HJEMMESIDE, ADOBE ELLER TREDJEPARTS ONLINE-TJENESTER OG
CERTIFIKATUDSTEDENDE MYNDIGHEDERS TJENESTER SOM DE ER OG FOREFINDES OG MED ALLE
FEJL. DENNE ANSVARSFRASKRIVELSE KAN VÆRE UGYLDIG I NOGLE RETSOMRÅDER. KUNDEN KAN
HAVE ANDRE RETTIGHEDER I HENHOLD TIL LOVGIVNINGEN, SOM IKKE KAN FRAFALDES ELLER
FRASKRIVES. ADOBE FORSØGER IKKE AT BEGRÆNSE KUNDENS GARANTIRETTIGHEDER PÅ NOGEN
MÅDE, DER IKKE ER TILLADT IFØLGE LOVGIVNINGEN. Bestemmelserne i afsnit 7 og 8 vil fortsat være
gældende efter aftalens ophør uanset årsag. Dette indebærer dog ikke en fortsat ret til at bruge
softwaren efter denne aftales ophør.

ADOBE, OG ENHVER MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSE, SOM IKKE KAN FRAVIGES ELLER BEGRÆNSES I
HENHOLD TIL LOVGIVNINGEN, ER ADOBE, DETS ASSOCIEREDE ENHEDER, LEVERANDØRER OG
CERTIFIKATUDSTEDENDE MYNDIGHEDER I INTET TILFÆLDE ERSTATNINGSANSVARLIGE OVER FOR
KUNDEN FOR TAB, SKADER, KRAV ELLER ANDRE OMKOSTNINGER UANSET DISSES ART, HERUNDER
DIREKTE, INDIREKTE ELLER HÆNDELIGE SKADER, TABT ARBEJDSFORTJENESTE ELLER MISTET

MANGLENDE OPFYLDELSE AF OMSORGSFORPLIGTELSE, ELLER KRAV FREMSAT AF TREDJEPART OG
DETTE UANSET, OM EN ADOBE-REPRÆSENTANT MÅTTE VÆRE BLEVET UNDERRETTET OM
MULIGHEDEN FOR SÅDANNE TAB, SKADESERSTATNINGER, KRAV ELLER OMKOSTNINGER. DEN
SAMLEDE HÆFTELSE FOR ADOBE, DETS ASSOCIEREDE ENHEDER, LEVERANDØRER OG
CERTIFIKATUDSTEDENDE MYNDIGHEDER I MEDFØR AF ELLER I FORBINDELSE MED DENNE AFTALE,
ER I ALLE TILFÆLDE BEGRÆNSET TIL DET BELØB, SOM MÅTTE VÆRE BETALT FOR SOFTWAREN.
DENNE BEGRÆNSNING GÆLDER OGSÅ I TILFÆLDE AF VÆSENTLIG MISLIGHOLDELSE ELLER I
TILFÆLDE AF MISLIGHOLDELSE AF DENNE AFTALES VÆSENTLIGE BESTEMMELSER. Intet i denne
aftale begrænser Adobes ansvar over for kunden i tilfælde af død eller personskade som følge af
Adobes uagtsomhed eller svig. Adobe agerer på vegne af sine associerede enheder, leverandører og
certifikatudstedende myndigheder i henseende til fraskrivelse, udelukkelse og begrænsning af
forpligtelser, garantier og ansvar, men ikke i andre henseender eller for noget andet formål.
OVENSTÅENDE BEGRÆNSNINGER OG FRASKRIVELSER FINDER ANVENDELSE I DET OMFANG,
GÆLDENDE LOV I KUNDENS RETSOMRÅDE TILLADER DET. DENNE ANSVARSBEGRÆNSNING KAN
VÆRE UGYLDIG I NOGLE RETSOMRÅDER. KUNDEN KAN HAVE ANDRE RETTIGHEDER, SOM I
HENHOLD TIL LOV OM FORBRUGERBESKYTTELSE OG ANDRE LOVE IKKE KAN FRAFALDES. ADOBE
FORSØGER IKKE AT BEGRÆNSE DERES GARANTI ELLER MISLIGHOLDELSESBEFØJELSER PÅ NOGEN
MÅDE, SOM IKKE ER TILLADT IFØLGE LOVGIVNINGEN. SE AFSNIT 16 FOR RETSOMRÅDESPECIFIKKE
ERKLÆRINGER.
9. Eksportregler.
Kunden anerkender, at Softwaren er underlagt den amerikanske eksportlovgivning (U.S. Export
Administrations Regulations) (”EAR”), og at kunden vil overholde EAR. Kunden må ikke eksportere eller
reeksportere softwaren, direkte eller indirekte til: (a) nogen lande, som er underkastet amerikanske
eksportrestriktioner (inklusive, men ikke nødvendigvis begrænset til Cuba, Iran, Nordkorea, Sudan og
Syrien), (b) enhver slutbruger, som kunden ved eller har grund til at tro, vil udnytte softwaren i
konstruktionen, udviklingen eller produktionen af atomvåben, kemiske eller biologiske våben, eller
raketsystemer, rumfartøjer og raketsonder, eller ubemandede luftfartøjer, eller (c) enhver slutbruger,
som er blevet forhindret i at deltage i amerikanske eksporttransaktioner af en føderal myndighed under
den amerikanske stat. Kunden er herudover ansvarlig for at overholde alle lokale love i kundens
retsområde, som kan påvirke dennes ret til at importere, eksportere eller bruge softwaren. Hvis Adobe
har kendskab til, at der er fundet en overtrædelse sted, kan Adobe være forhindret i at levere
vedligeholdelse og support til Softwaren.
10. Lovvalg.
Såfremt kunden er en forbruger, som kun anvender softwaren til personlige, ikke-erhvervsmæssige
formål, reguleres denne aftale af lovgivningen i det retsområde, hvor kunden har købt licensen til at
anvende softwaren. Hvis kunden ikke er en sådan forbruger, skal denne aftale reguleres af og fortolkes
efter gældende ret i: (a) staten Californien, hvis en licens til softwaren anskaffes, mens kunden opholder
sig i USA, Canada eller Mexico; eller (b) Japan, hvis en licens til softwaren anskaffes, mens kunden
opholder sig i Japan; eller (c) Singapore, hvis en licens til softwaren anskaffes, mens kunden opholder
sig i et af medlemslandene i Sammenslutningen af Sydøstasiatiske Nationer, Fastlandskina, Hong Kong
--- Page 68 ---
S.A.R., Macau S.A.R., Taiwan eller Sydkorea; eller (d) England og Wales, hvis en licens til softwaren
anskaffes, mens kunden opholder sig i et retsområde, der ikke er beskrevet ovenfor. Domstolene i
henholdsvis Santa Clara County, Californien, hvor californisk ret er gældende, Tokyo District Court i
Japan, hvor japansk ret er gældende, og kompetente domstole i London, England, hvor engelsk og
walisisk ret er gældende, skal have ikke-eksklusiv jurisdiktion i henseende til alle tvister vedrørende
denne aftale. Når Singapores lovgivning gælder, henvises tvister, der måtte opstå som følge af eller i
forbindelse med denne aftale, herunder alle spørgsmål om dens eksistens, gyldighed eller ophør, til
Singapore, hvor de skal afgøres vha. voldgift i overensstemmelse med de gældende voldgiftsregler i
Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) – disse regler skal anses for at indgå i denne aftale
ifølge henvisningen til dette afsnit. Parterne skal sammen udpege en voldgiftsmand. Hvis
voldgiftsmanden ikke udpeges inden for tredive (30) dage efter, at en af parterne har sendt en skriftlig
anmodning om at acceptere voldgiften, skal formanden for SIAC tage denne beslutning. Sproget for
voldgiften skal være engelsk. Til trods for bestemmelserne i denne aftale kan Adobe eller kunden
anmode en retsmæssig, administrativ eller anden myndighed om at beordre en foreløbig eller sikrende
forholdsregel, herunder pålæggelse af foreløbige forbud eller påbud, naturalopfyldelse eller andre
rimelige retsmidler, inden eller under de retsmæssige eller voldgiftsmæssige processer, med henblik på
at opretholde den pågældende parts rettigheder og interesser eller for at håndhæve visse betingelser,
som er egnede til pålæggelse af foreløbige beføjelser. Nærværende aftale er ikke underlagt følgende,
hvis anvendelse hermed udtrykkeligt er udelukket ved nærværende aftale: (x) lovvalgsregler for noget
retsområde, (y) de Forenede Nationers konvention om aftaler om internationale køb og (z) UCITA
(Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act) som vedtaget i ethvert retsområde.
11. Generelle bestemmelser.
Hvis en del af denne aftale erklæres ugyldig eller ikke kan håndhæves, påvirker det ikke gyldigheden af
den øvrige del af denne aftale, som fortsat er gyldig og kan håndhæves i henhold til dens vilkår.
Ændringer af denne aftale skal ske skriftligt og underskrives af en befuldmægtiget repræsentant for
Adobe. Den engelske version af denne aftale vil være gældende ved fortolkning eller udlægning af
denne aftale. Denne aftale udgør den samlede aftale mellem Adobe og kunden i henseende til
softwaren, og den træder i stedet for enhver form for tidligere tilkendegivelse, diskussion, løfte,
meddelelse eller annoncering vedrørende softwaren.
12. Bemærkninger til slutbrugere i den amerikanske forvaltning.
12.1 Adobe Technologys licensudstedelse til den amerikanske forvaltning. Kunden accepterer, at licens
til Adobe Software erhvervet af den amerikanske forvaltning eller dennes underleverandører erhverves
iht. praksis angivet i 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 (for civile myndigheder) og 48 C.F.R. Sections 227.7202-1
og 227.7202-4 (for forsvarsministeriet). For så vidt angår slutbrugere i den amerikanske forvaltning
forpligter Adobe sig til at overholde alle love om ligebehandling, herunder bestemmelserne i Executive
Order 11246, med senere ændringer, paragraf 402 i loven ”Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment
Assistance Act” af 1974 (38 USC 4212) og paragraf 503 i loven ”Rehabilitation Act” af 1973, med senere
ændringer, samt reglerne i 41 CFR Parts 60-1, 60-60, 60-250 og 60-741. Reglen om positiv
særbehandling og bestemmelserne i foregående afsnit vil ved henvisning dertil udgøre en del af denne
aftale.
12.2 Commercial Items. For så vidt angår slutbrugere i den amerikanske forvaltning, er softwaren
”Commercial Item(s)”, som dette begreb er defineret i 48 C.F.R. paragraf 2.101, og består af ”Commercial
Computer Software” og ”Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, således som disse begreber er
anvendt i 48 C.F.R. paragraf 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R. paragraf 227.7202, i det omfang, disse bestemmelser
måtte finde anvendelse. I overensstemmelse med 48 C.F.R. paragraf 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R.
paragraf 227.7202-1 til 227.7202-4, i det omfang, disse bestemmelser måtte finde anvendelse, gives denne
”Commercial Computer Software” og ”Commercial Computer Software Documentation” i licens til
slutbrugere i den amerikanske forvaltning (a) alene som ”Commercial Items” og (b) alene med de
--- Page 69 ---
rettigheder, der gives alle andre slutbrugere i medfør af denne aftales vilkår og betingelser. Der tages
forbehold for ikke-offentliggjorte rettigheder i henhold til den i USA gældende ophavsretslovgivning.
13. Overholdelse af licensvilkår.
Hvis kunden er en virksomhed, et selskab eller en organisation, accepterer kunden hermed, at Adobe
eller en af Adobe bemyndiget repræsentant, ud over kontrol af overholdelse af licensen udført af
softwaren, højst hver tolvte (12.) måned med syv (7) dages forudgående varsel har ret til at inspicere
kundens optegnelser, systemer og anlæg for at verificere, at brugen af al software eller tjenesteydelser
fra Adobe er i overensstemmelse med kundens gyldige licenser fra Adobe. For eksempel har Adobe ret
til den del af kundens dokumentation, som kan bidrage til at afgøre, om installationer af softwaren er
blevet serialiseret, og kunden skal udlevere den pågældende dokumentation, så snart Adobe måtte
anmode herom. Kunden skal herudover forsyne Adobe med alle optegnelser og oplysninger, som
Adobe anmoder om, for at bekræfte, at kundens anvendelse af nogen eller al Adobe-software er i
overensstemmelse med dennes gyldige licenser fra Adobe, inden tredive (30) dage efter Adobes
anmodning. Der er flere oplysninger om serialisering på http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_dk.
14. Internetforbindelse og beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger.
14.1 Automatisk forbindelse til internettet. Softwaren kan bevirke, at kundens computer uden varsel
automatisk opretter forbindelse til internettet og kommunikerer med et af Adobes websteder eller
Adobes domæne med henblik på f.eks. licensvalidering eller for at kunden kan få leveret yderligere
oplysninger, faciliteter og funktionalitet. Medmindre andet er angivet i afsnit 14.2 til og med 14.7,
gælder følgende bestemmelser for alle automatiske internetforbindelser, som softwaren foretager:
14.1.1 Når softwaren opretter forbindelse til internettet og kommunikerer med en Adobe-hjemmeside,
uanset om det sker automatisk eller på brugerens anmodning, er politikken om beskyttelse af
personlige oplysninger gældende. Adobes politik om beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger tillader
sporíng (tracking) af besøg på hjemmesider, og den giver udførlig information om emnerne sporing
(tracking) og brug af cookies, web-beacons og lignende.
14.1.2 Når som helst softwaren opretter forbindelse til Adobe via internettet, indsamles og overføres
bestemte oplysninger om kunden af softwaren til Adobe i henhold til Adobes online-politik om
beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger, som er tilgængelig på http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_dk
(”Privacy Policy”).
14.1.3 Hvis kunden anvender en Adobe online-tjeneste (som defineret i afsnit 16.4 herunder) eller
aktiverer eller registrerer softwaren, bliver yderligere oplysninger såsom kundens Adobe-id, brugernavn
og adgangskode muligvis overført og gemt af Adobe i henhold til politikken om beskyttelse af
personlige oplysninger og yderligere vilkår for brug i forbindelse med en sådan Adobe online-tjeneste
(sammen med vilkårene for brug på Adobe.com og alle gældende vilkår benævnt ”Yderligere vilkår for
brug”).
14.1.4 Som tilladt ifølge gældende lovgivning eller efter kundens accept kan Adobe (a) sende kunden
transaktionsmeddelelser for at lette gennemførelse af Adobe online-tjenesten eller aktiveringen eller
registreringen af softwaren eller Adobe online-tjenesten eller (b) levere markedsføringsmateriale i selve
produktet for at informere om softwaren og andre Adobe-produkter og -tjenester ved hjælp af
oplysninger, herunder men ikke begrænset til versionen af platformen og softwaren, licensstatus og
sprog.
14.2 Opdatering. Softwaren kan bevirke, at kundens computer uden yderligere varsel automatisk
opretter forbindelse til internettet (periodisk eller med regelmæssige mellemrum) for at (a) søge efter
opdateringer, som er tilgængelige for download og installation på computeren og (b) for at oplyse
Adobe om resultaterne af installationsforsøg.
--- Page 70 ---
14.3 Aktivering. Softwaren kan kræve, at kunden (a) erhverver et Adobe-id, (b) aktiverer eller
genaktiverer softwaren, (c) registrerer softwaren eller (d) validerer medlemskabet. Et sådant krav kan
bevirke, at kundens computer uden varsel opretter forbindelse til internettet ved installation, ved start
og med regelmæssige mellemrum derefter. Når softwaren har oprettet forbindelse, vil den indsamle og
overføre oplysninger til Adobe som beskrevet på http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_dk (”Activation
Terms”). Softwaren eller kunden kan også modtage oplysninger fra Adobe i forbindelse med kundens
licens, abonnement eller medlemskab. Adobe kan bruge denne type oplysninger til at spore eller
forhindre svigagtig eller uautoriseret brug, som ikke er i overensstemmelse med en gyldig licens eller et
gyldigt abonnement eller medlemskab. Manglende aktivering eller registrering af softwaren, validering
af abonnementet eller medlemskabet eller en afgørelse fra Adobe om svigagtig eller uautoriseret brug
af softwaren kan medføre reduceret funktionalitet, ikke-funktionsdygtig software eller afbrydelse eller
midlertidig ophævelse af abonnementet eller medlemskabet.
14.4 Deaktivering. Kunden kan deaktivere og afinstallere softwaren på sin computer for at installere og
aktivere softwaren på en anden computer i henhold til denne aftale (”Deaktivering”) og som yderligere
beskrevet på http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_dk. Deaktivering kræver internetforbindelse.
14.5 Brug af online-tjenester. Softwaren kan uden yderligere varsel og enten periodisk eller med
regelmæssige mellemrum automatisk oprette forbindelse på kundens computer til internettet for at
lette kundens adgang til indhold og tjenester, der leveres af Adobe eller tredjepart, som yderligere
beskrevet i afsnit 16.4 (online-tjenester). Softwaren kan endvidere uden yderligere varsel automatisk
oprette forbindelse til internettet for at opdatere materialer, der kan downloades fra disse online-
tjenester, for også at give øjeblikkelig adgang til disse tjenester, når kunden er offline.
14.6 Digitale certifikater. Softwaren bruger digitale certifikater (som beskrevet i afsnit 16.5) for at hjælpe
kunden med at identificere downloadede filer (f.eks. programmer og indhold) samt udgiverne af disse
filer. Adobe AIR bruger f.eks. digitale certifikater til at hjælpe kunden med at identificere udgiveren af
Adobe AIR-applikationer. Adobe Acrobat-produktfamilien anvender også digitale certifikater til at
signere og validere signaturer i PDF-dokumenter og til at validere certificerede PDF-dokumenter.
Kundens computer opretter muligvis forbindelse til internettet ved validering af et digitalt certifikat.
14.7 Settings Manager. Softwaren kan omfatte Flash Player. Flash Player kan gemme visse
brugerindstillinger ved at lagre dem på kundens computer som et lokalt delt objekt. De er knyttet til
programmet Flash Player på computeren, så kunden kan tilpasse runtime-funktioner. Med Flash Player
Settings Manager kan kunden ændre disse indstillinger, herunder muligheden for at begrænse
tredjeparters adgang til at lagre lokale delte objekter eller tildele tredjepartsindhold adgangsrettigheder
til computerens mikrofon og kamera. Der er flere oplysninger om, hvordan man konfigurerer
indstillingerne i versionen af Flash Player, herunder oplysninger om deaktivering af lokale delte objekter
med Flash Player Settings Manager, på http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_dk. Der er flere
oplysninger om lokale delte objekter på http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_dk.
15. Peer-to-peer-kommunikation.
Softwaren kan benytte kundens forbindelse til et lokalt netværk til uden yderligere varsel automatisk at
oprette forbindelse til anden Adobe-software og derved angive på det lokale netværk, at den er
tilgængelig for kommunikation med anden Adobe-software. Disse forbindelser kan overføre IP-
adressen på kundens forbindelse til det lokale netværk.
16. Specifikke bestemmelser og undtagelser.
Nærværende afsnit indeholder særlige bestemmelser for bestemte produkter og komponenter i
softwaren samt begrænsede undtagelser til de ovenfor anførte vilkår og betingelser. I det omfang en
bestemmelse i dette afsnit er i modstrid med andre vilkår og betingelser i denne aftale, vil vilkårene
anført i dette afsnit have forrang for sådanne andre vilkår og betingelser.
--- Page 71 ---
16.1 Ingen præjudice, bestemmelser for Det Europæiske Økonomiske Samarbejdsområde (EØS),
obligatorisk besked vedr. Australien.
16.1.1 Denne aftale vil ikke forringe de lovfæstede rettigheder, som nogen, herunder de, der handler
som forbrugere, måtte have. For eksempel reguleres denne aftale af ”Consumer Guarantees Act” for
forbrugere i New Zealand, der anskaffer softwaren til personlig brug eller hjemme- eller
husholdningsbrug (ikke til erhverv).
16.1.2 Hvis kunden har købt softwaren inden for Det Europæiske Økonomiske Samarbejdsområde
(EØS), hvis kunden som regel er bosiddende i EØS og er forbruger (dvs. kunden bruger softwaren til
personlige, ikke-forretningsmæssige formål), gælder afsnit 6 (Begrænset garanti) ikke for kundens køb
og anvendelse af softwaren. I stedet garanterer Adobe i en periode på 2 år fra købstidspunktet, at
softwaren leverer de funktionaliteter, der er beskrevet i den relevante brugerhåndbog (de ”aftalte
funktionaliteter”), når den anvendes på den kompatible computer. Uvæsentlig variation i de aftalte
funktionaliteter vil ikke kunne godtgøre garantirettigheder. DENNE GARANTI GÆLDER IKKE FOR
SOFTWARE, SOM KUNDEN BENYTTER SOM PRE-RELEASE, PRØVE, STARTPAKKE ELLER
PRODUKTPRØVE, ELLER FOR FONTSOFTWARE, ELLER HVIS SOFTWAREN IKKE FUNGERER, FORDI
DEN ER BLEVET ÆNDRET AF KUNDEN. For at komme med et garantikrav skal kunden meddele dette til
Adobes kundeserviceafdeling inden for denne 2-årige periode samt indgive købsbevis for softwaren.
Adobe vil undersøge, om der er en fejl i softwaren, eller meddele kunden, at fejlen opstår, fordi kunden
ikke har installeret softwaren korrekt (er det tilfældet, vil Adobe hjælpe kunden). Hvis der er en fejl i
softwaren, kan kunden anmode Adobe om enten tilbagebetaling af købesummen eller reparation eller
ombytning af softwaren. Anmodninger skal indsendes sammen med købsbevis. Hvis kundens
garantikrav kan dokumenteres, vil Adobe imødekomme kundens krav om reparation eller ombytning,
medmindre det ikke er rimeligt for Adobe. I sådanne tilfælde vil Adobe tilbagebetale købsprisen.
Kunden kan få hjælp i forbindelse med garantien ved at kontakte Adobes kundeserviceafdeling.
Bemærk, at bestemmelserne i afsnit 8 (Ansvarsbegrænsning) fortsat er gældende for de erstatningskrav,
kunden måtte gøre gældende i forbindelse med brugen af softwaren. Adobe er dog ansvarlig for direkte
tab, som er rimeligt forudsigelige i tilfælde af brud på denne aftale fra Adobes side. Kunden anmodes
om at træffe alle rimelige foranstaltninger for at undgå og reducere skader, især ved at tage
sikkerhedskopier af softwaren og computerdataene.
Denne aftale og især dette afsnit 16.1.2 beskriver kundens rettigheder (herunder dennes lovmæssige
rettigheder) i tilfælde af, at der opstår problemer med brugen af softwaren. Hvis kundens lovfæstede
rettigheder er mere omfattende end denne beskrivelse, er kundens lovfæstede rettigheder gældende.
16.1.3 Intet i denne aftale (herunder afsnit 4.4) begrænser nogen ret, der ikke kan tilsidesættes, til at
dekompilere den software, som kunden må benytte ifølge gældende lovgivning. Hvis kunden for
eksempel befinder sig inden for Den Europæiske Union (EU), har kunden måske ret til på visse
betingelser, som er specificeret i den relevante lovgivning, at dekompilere software, hvis dette er
nødvendigt for interoperabiliteten mellem softwaren og et andet softwareprogram, og kunden forinden
skriftligt har bedt Adobe om at levere de oplysninger, som er nødvendige, for at denne operabilitet kan
opnås, og Adobe ikke har stillet disse oplysninger til rådighed. Derudover må en sådan dekompilering
kun udføres af kunden eller af en person, som har ret til at benytte en kopi af softwaren på kundens
vegne. Adobe har ret til at kræve rimelige betingelser opfyldt, før sådanne oplysninger leveres. Alle
oplysninger, der leveres af Adobe, eller som er erhvervet af kunden, som tilladt ifølge nærværende
aftale, må kun anvendes af kunden til det heri beskrevne formål og må ikke videregives til tredjemand
eller anvendes til at skabe software, som udviser betydelig lighed med softwarens udtryk, eller anvendes
til nogen handling, som krænker Adobes eller selskabets licensgiveres ophavsret.
16.1.4 Hvis kunden anskaffer softwaren i Australien, finder følgende bestemmelse anvendelse, uanset
modstridende indhold i denne aftale:
--- Page 72 ---
BESKED TIL FORBRUGERE I AUSTRALIEN:
Vores varer leveres med garantier, der ikke kan udelukkes i henhold til australsk forbrugerlovgivning.
Du har ret til ombytning eller tilbagebetaling af købesummen ved væsentlige mangler og til godtgørelse
ved alle andre tab eller skader, der er rimeligt forudsigelige. Du har også ret til at få varerne repareret
eller ombyttet, hvis varerne ikke er af acceptabel kvalitet, og fejlen ikke udgør en væsentlig fejl. Vores
softwareprodukter har også en begrænset garanti på 90 dage, der ydes af Adobe Systems Software
Ireland Limited, hvis kontor er beliggende på 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24,
Irland, som beskrevet i aftalen. Hvis produkterne ikke har de generelle funktioner, der er beskrevet i
brugerdokumentationen inden for 90 dage efter levering, skal du ringe til Adobes kundeserviceafdeling
på 1800 614 863 med oplysninger om produkt, serienummer og købsbevis. Du skal muligvis returnere
softwareproduktet til den adresse, vi oplyser på det tidspunkt, og hvis det er tilfældet, vil
forsendelsesomkostningerne påhvile dig. Fordelene i henhold til denne garanti er et tillæg til andre
rettigheder og misligholdelsesbeføjelser, du måtte have ifølge lovgivning.
16.2 Yderligere vilkår for ”pre-release”-softwaren. Hvis softwaren er en før-kommerciel udgivelse eller
beta-software (”pre-release”-software), gælder nærværende afsnit. Pre-release-softwaren er ikke et
udtryk for det endelige produkt fra Adobe og kan indeholde fejl og andre problemer, som kan medføre
systemfejl eller andre fejl samt tab af data. Adobe kan vælge aldrig at udgive Pre-release-softwaren
kommercielt. Hvis kunden har modtaget pre-release-softwaren i medfør af en separat skriftlig aftale,
f.eks. ”Adobe Systems Incorporated Serial Agreement for Pre-release Software”, reguleres kundens brug
af softwaren af den pågældende aftale. Kunden skal straks returnere eller ødelægge alle kopier af pre-
release-softwaren på Adobes anmodning eller på tidspunktet for Adobes kommercielle udgivelse af
sådan software, alt efter hvad der indtræffer først. KUNDENS BRUG AF PRE-RELEASE-SOFTWARE SKER
PÅ EGEN RISIKO. SE AFSNIT 6 OG 8 VEDRØRENDE BEGRÆNSET GARANTI OG
ANSVARSBEGRÆNSNINGER I FORHOLD TIL PRE-RELEASE-SOFTWARE.
16.3 Undervisningssoftware. Hvis softwaren er et undervisningssoftwareprodukt (software produceret
og distribueret alene til brug for undervisningsslutbrugere), må kunden ikke bruge softwaren,
medmindre denne er undervisningsslutbruger. Besøg http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_dk
for at få at vide, om disse betingelser er opfyldt. Besøg http://www.adobe.com/go/store_dk, og søg efter
linket for Buying Adobe Products Worldwide (forhandling af Adobe produkter på verdensplan) for at
finde en forhandler af Adobe Authorized Academic i nærområdet.
16.4 Online-tjenester.
16.4.1 Leveret af Adobe. Softwaren letter kundens adgang til indhold og forskellige tjenester, der findes
på websteder drevet af Adobe eller dets associerede enheder (”Adobe online-tjenester”). Eksempler på
sådanne Adobe online-tjenester kan omfatte, men er ikke begrænset til: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS
Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help og
produktvelkomstskærmbilleder. I nogle tilfælde kan en Adobe online-tjeneste fremkomme som en
facilitet eller udvidelse i softwaren, selvom den er anbragt på et websted. Adgang til en Adobe online-
tjeneste kan kræve, at kunden aktiverer softwaren, erhverver et Adobe-id, accepterer de yderligere
vilkår for brug, eller det vil kræve en særlig afgift for at få adgang til en sådan Adobe online-tjeneste.
Adobe online-tjenester er muligvis ikke tilgængelige på alle sprog eller for indbyggere i alle lande, og
Adobe kan til enhver tid og uden nærmere begrundelse modificere eller afbryde adgangen til enhver
Adobe online-tjeneste. Adobe forbeholder sig også ret til at begynde at kræve betaling for adgang til
eller brug af en Adobe online-tjeneste, der tidligere var gratis. Afsnit 14 anfører vigtige oplysninger om
internetforbindelse og beskyttelse af kundens personlige oplysninger. Som anført i afsnit 14 gælder, at
når softwaren får adgang til en Adobe online-tjeneste, er kundens brug af en sådan Adobe online-
tjeneste underlagt Adobes politik om beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_dk), vilkårene for brug af Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_dk) samt alle yderligere vilkår for brug, som kunden måtte få vist på
det pågældende tidspunkt.
--- Page 73 ---
16.4.2 Leveret af tredjepart. Softwaren kan lette kundens adgang til websteder drevet af tredjepart, der
tilbyder varer, information, software og tjenester (”tredjeparts online-tjenester”). Eksempler på sådanne
tredjeparts online-tjenester kunne omfatte, men er ikke begrænset til, Kodak EasyShare Gallery.
Kundens adgang til og brug af enhver tredjeparts online-tjeneste er underlagt de vilkår, betingelser,
ansvarsfraskrivelser og meddelelser, der findes på sådanne websteder, eller på anden måde er tilknyttet
sådanne tredjeparts online-tjenester. Adobe kontrollerer ikke, står ikke inde for og accepterer ikke
ansvar for tredjeparts online-tjenester. Enhver transaktion mellem kunden og tredjepart i tilknytning til
en tredjeparts online-tjeneste, herunder tredjepartens politik om beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger
(fortrolighedspolitik) og brug af kundens personlige oplysninger, levering af og betaling for varer og
tjenesteydelser samt alle andre vilkår, betingelser, garantier eller tilsikringer i tilknytning til sådanne
transaktioner, vedrører alene og er alene indgået mellem kunden og den pågældende tredjepart.
Tredjeparts online-tjenester er muligvis ikke tilgængelige på alle sprog eller for indbyggere i alle lande,
og Adobe kan til enhver tid og uden nærmere begrundelse modificere eller afbryde adgangen til enhver
tredjeparts online-tjeneste.
16.4.3 BORTSET FRA HVOR DET ER UDTRYKKELIGT AFTALT MED ADOBE ELLER DETS ASSOCIEREDE
ENHEDER ELLER MED TREDJEPART I EN SEPARAT AFTALE, SKER KUNDENS BRUG AF ADOBE OG
TREDJEPARTS ONLINE-TJENESTER FOR DENNES EGEN RISIKO OG UNDER DEN GARANTI OG DE
ANSVARSBEGRÆNSNINGER, DER FREMGÅR AF AFSNIT 7 OG 8.
16.5 Digitale certifikater.
16.5.1 Brug. Digitale certifikater udstedes af certifikatudstedende tredjepartsmyndigheder, herunder
udbydere af Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS), som er angivet på
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_dk, og udbyderne på Adobe Approved Trust List (”AATL”),
som er angivet på http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_dk (samlet kaldet ”certifikatudstedende
myndigheder”), eller de kan være selvsignerede.
16.5.2 Vilkår og betingelser. Ansvaret for køb af, brug af og tillid til digitale certifikater ligger hos kunden
og en certifikatudstedende myndighed. Inden kunden stoler på et certificeret dokument, en digital
signatur eller en certifikatudstedende myndighed, bør kunden gennemgå alle gældende vilkår og
betingelser for den pågældende certifikatudstedende myndigheds tjenester, herunder for eksempel alle
abonnementsaftaler, certifikatmodtageraftaler, certifikatpolitikker og erklæringer vedrørende praksis. Se
linkene på http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_dk for at få oplysninger om Adobes CDS-
leverandører og http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_dk for oplysninger om AATL-leverandører.
16.5.3 Bekræftelse. Kunden er indforstået med, at (a) softwaren, som følge af konfiguration eller
eksterne problemer, kan vise en signatur som gyldig, selvom et digitalt certifikat muligvis kan være
tilbagekaldt eller udløbet på verificeringstidspunktet, (b) en digital signaturs sikkerhed eller integritet
kan være kompromitteret på grund af handlinger eller udeladelser fra den, der har signeret
dokumentet, den pågældende certifikatudstedende myndighed eller en anden tredjepart, og (c) at et
certifikat kan være selvsigneret og ikke udstedt af en certifikatudstedende myndighed. KUNDEN ER
ALENE ANSVARLIG FOR AT AFGØRE, OM HAN ELLER HUN VIL STOLE PÅ ET CERTIFIKAT ELLER EJ.
MEDMINDRE EN SEPARAT SKRIFTLIG GARANTI ER UDSTEDT AF EN CERTIFIKATUDSTEDENDE
MYNDIGHED, ER KUNDENS BRUG AF DIGITALE CERTIFIKATER HELT PÅ EGEN RISIKO.
16.5.4 Tredjepartbegunstigede. Kunden er indforstået med, at enhver certifikatudstedende myndighed,
som kunden stoler på, er en tredjepartbegunstiget i forhold til denne aftale og vil være berettiget til at
håndhæve denne aftale i eget navn som værende Adobe.
16.5.5 Skadesløsholdelse. Kunden er indforstået med at holde Adobe og enhver relevant
certifikatudstedende myndighed (medmindre andet udtrykkeligt er angivet i vilkår og betingelser)
skadesløs, hvad angår enhver form for ansvar, tab, retshandlinger, erstatninger eller krav (herunder alle
rimelige udgifter, omkostninger og advokatsalærer), som måtte opstå i forbindelse med brugen af eller
tilliden til en tjeneste fra enhver sådan myndighed, herunder, men ikke begrænset til: (a) tillid til et
udløbet eller tilbagekaldt certifikat; (b) urigtig verificering af et certifikat; (c) brug af et certifikat på
måder, der ikke er tilladt under gældende vilkår og betingelser, denne aftale eller gældende lov;
--- Page 74 ---
(d) undladelse af at udvise rimelig dømmekraft i situationer, hvor der stoles på udstedende tjeneste eller

kommerciel printer- eller andet servicebureau, og et sådant servicebureau er berettiget til at bruge
fonten(e) til at behandle kundens fil, hvis servicebureauet har en gyldig licens til at bruge den
pågældende fontsoftware.
16.6.4 Kunden er berettiget til at integrere kopier af fontsoftwaren i sine elektroniske dokumenter med
det formål at udskrive, se og redigere dokumentet på skærmen. Ingen andre rettigheder til indlejring er
underforståede eller tilladte i henhold til denne aftale.
16.6.5 Som en undtagelse fra ovenstående er de fonte, der står på listen på
http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_dk, kun inkluderet i softwaren med henblik på drift af
softwarens brugergrænseflade og ikke til benyttelse i nogen form for outputfiler. Fonte på denne liste er
ikke givet i licens ifølge afsnit 16.6. Kunden er indforstået med ikke at kopiere, flytte, aktivere, benytte
eller tillade, at nogen form for fontadministrationsværktøj anvendes til at kopiere, flytte, aktivere eller
benytte fontene på denne liste sammen med nogen form for softwareapplikation, programmer eller filer
bortset fra softwaren.

software, idet prøveversioner af Adobe Contribute-software dog gerne må installeres og forbindes til
Contribute Publishing Services-software i overensstemmelse med softwareslutbrugerlicensaftalen for
Contribute Publishing Services.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Hvis Adobe Presenter indgår i softwaren, og kunden installerer eller bruger
Adobe Connect Add-in i forbindelse med brug af softwaren, accepterer kunden udelukkende at

af en sådan præsentation, information eller et sådant indhold ikke ændrer, foretager reverse
engineering eller adskiller Adobe Presenter Run-Time.
16.12 Flash Builder med LiveCycle Data Services (LCDS) Data Management Library. Adobe Flash Builder
kan indeholde fds.swc library. Kunden må kun benytte fds.swc til dataadministrationsfunktioner på
klientsiden og som outputfil i software, som kunden udvikler, på følgende betingelser: Kunden må ikke
(a) bruge fds.swc til at aktivere associationer eller offline-funktioner i software eller (b) indlejre fds.swc i

af ovennævnte, skal kunden anmode Adobe om en separat licens.
16.13 Digital Publishing Suite. Følgende vilkår er gældende, hvis softwaren indeholder bestemte
komponenter eller funktioner, der er udviklet til at fungere sammen med eller tilgå Digital Publishing
Suite, underlagt de yderligere vilkår for brug for Digital Publishing Suite. ”DPS Desktop Tools” betyder

2. Softwarelicentie; lidmaatschap.
2.1 Softwarelicentie. Dit artikel 2.1 is van toepassing op Klanten die een licentie voor de Software
hebben aanschaft, maar geen licentie of dienst met een lidmaatschap hebben aangeschaft, zoals het
lidmaatschap Creative Cloud (zoals beschreven in artikel 2.2).
2.1.1 Toekenning van licentie. Op voorwaarde dat de Klant zich doorlopend aan deze Overeenkomst
houdt en de bijbehorende licentievergoedingen voldoet, verleent Adobe de Klant een niet-exclusieve
en beperkte licentie om de Software te installeren en gebruiken (a) in het territorium of de regio waar
de Klant de Software verkrijgt van Adobe of een geautoriseerde leverancier van Adobe of zoals
anderszins is vermeld in de Documentatie (“Territorium”), (b) gedurende de looptijd van deze licentie

Compatibele computers van de Klant, zoals is opgegeven in de Documentatie, en (d) volgens de
voorwaarden van deze overeenkomst en toepasselijke Documentatie. Tenzij anderszins is vermeld in
deze overeenkomst, in de toepasselijke Documentatie of op het moment van de aanschaf, is de
Licentietermijn oneindig. Wanneer de Licentietermijn is verstreken, is het zonder voorafgaande
kennisgeving mogelijk dat de Software geheel of gedeeltelijk niet langer werkt. Wanneer de
Licentietermijn is verstreken of beëindigd, mag de Klant de Software pas weer gebruiken wanneer de
Klant de licentie heeft vernieuwd. De in deze overeenkomst verleende licentie wordt aangevuld met
specifieke bepalingen in artikel 16 in verband met het gebruik van bepaalde toepasselijke producten en
onderdelen die mogelijk in de Software zijn opgenomen, waaronder fontsoftware, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite en Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 Licentietypen.
2.1.2.1 Software zonder serienummer. De Software, of delen van de Software, die zonder serienummer
zijn verstrekt tijdens de Licentietermijn, mogen alleen gedurende de Licentietermijn voor demonstratie-,
evaluatie- en trainingsdoeleinden worden geïnstalleerd en gebruikt op elk aantal Compatibele
computers als onderdeel van een bedrijfsimplementatieplan, en alleen indien Outputbestanden of
andere materialen die zijn geproduceerd met deze Software, uitsluitend voor gebruik voor interne, niet-
commerciële en niet-productiegerelateerde doeleinden. DE SOFTWARE ZONDER SERIENUMMER
WORDT “ALS ZODANIG” (AS IS) GELEVERD. TOEGANG TOT EN GEBRUIK VAN OUTPUTBESTANDEN
DIE ZIJN GEMAAKT MET DERGELIJKE SOFTWARE ZONDER SERIENUMMER, ZIJN GEHEEL VOOR
RISICO VAN DE KLANT.
2.1.2.2 Evaluatiesoftware. De volledige of gedeeltelijke Software die is verstrekt met een serienummer
dat is aangemerkt voor “evaluatiedoeleinden” of een andere soortgelijke aanduiding (zoals Software of
een serienummer dat als “EVAL” is geleverd onder een afzonderlijk besteldocument)
(“Evaluatiesoftware”), mag alleen gedurende de Licentietermijn voor demonstratie-, evaluatie- en
--- Page 79 ---
trainingsdoeleinden worden geïnstalleerd en gebruikt op het Toegestane aantal Compatibele
computers, en alleen als eventuele Outputbestanden of andere materialen die zijn geproduceerd door
dergelijk gebruik, uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor interne, niet-commerciële en niet-
productiegerelateerde doeleinden. DE EVALUATIESOFTWARE WORDT “ALS ZODANIG” (AS IS)
GELEVERD. TOEGANG TOT EN GEBRUIK VAN OUTPUTBESTANDEN DIE ZIJN GEMAAKT MET
DERGELIJKE EVALUATIESOFTWARE, ZIJN GEHEEL VOOR RISICO VAN DE KLANT.
2.1.2.3 Abonnementsversie. Voor de Software die beschikbaar is via een abonnement
(“Abonnementsversie”), mag de Klant gedurende de Licentietermijn de Abonnementsversie alleen
installeren en gebruiken op het Toegestane aantal Compatibele computers. Conform het Toegestane
aantal computers voor de Abonnementsversie kan Adobe de Klant toestaan om de meest recente
versie voorafgaand aan de Abonnementsversie en de huidige versie van de Abonnementsversie te
installeren en gebruiken op dezelfde Computer gedurende de Licentietermijn. De Klant stemt ermee in
dat Adobe op elk gewenst moment het in de Abonnementsversie opgenomen type Software kan
wijzigen (zoals specifieke onderdelen, versies, platforms, talen en dergelijke) en jegens de Klant op
generlei wijze aansprakelijk is voor een dergelijke wijziging. Voor doorlopende toegang tot een
Abonnementsversie is het volgende vereist: (a) een terugkerende internetverbinding om de licentie te
activeren, verlengen en valideren, (b) de ontvangst van terugkerende abonnementsbetalingen door
Adobe of diens geautoriseerde leveranciers, en (c) instemming van de Klant met de
abonnementsvoorwaarden en overige aanvullende bepalingen en voorwaarden die beschikbaar zijn op
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_nl of op het moment van de aanschaf. Als Adobe de
terugkerende abonnementsbetaling niet ontvangt of de licentie niet periodiek kan valideren, wordt de
Software zonder aanvullende kennisgeving gedeactiveerd totdat Adobe de betaling ontvangt of de
licentie valideert.
2.1.3 Gebruik op draagbare Computer of thuiscomputer. Behoudens de in artikel 2.1.4 vermelde
beperkingen mag de eerste gebruiker van de Computer waarop de Software is geïnstalleerd
krachtens artikel 2.1 (“Eerste gebruiker”) een tweede exemplaar van de Software voor zijn of haar
exclusieve gebruik op een draagbare Computer of Computer bij hem of haar thuis installeren, op
voorwaarde dat de Software op de draagbare Computer of thuiscomputer niet tegelijkertijd met de
Software op de primaire Computer wordt gebruikt.
2.1.4 Beperkingen op tweede gebruik door volumelicentienemers. Indien de Software is verkregen
onder een volumelicentieprogramma of -overeenkomst van Adobe (zoals Adobe Volume Licensing)
door een andere licentiehouder dan een educatieve volumelicentiehouder, mag het krachtens
artikel 2.1.3 gemaakte tweede exemplaar van de Software uitsluitend worden gebruikt ten behoeve en
voor de zakelijke doeleinden van de betreffende volumelicentiehouder.
2.1.5 Dual-bootplatform. De Software wordt in licentie verstrekt voor gebruik op een specifiek
besturingssysteemplatform. De Klant dient een aparte licentie aan te schaffen voor gebruik van de
Software op elk besturingssysteemplatform. Als de Klant bijvoorbeeld de Software zowel op het Mac-
als op het Windows-besturingssysteemplatform wil installeren, op een apparaat dat beide platforms
uitvoert (met andere woorden, een dual-bootcomputer), moet de Klant eerst twee aparte licenties voor
de Software aanschaffen. Dit geldt ook als twee versies van de Software, elk ontworpen voor een ander
besturingssysteemplatform, op dezelfde gegevensdrager worden geleverd aan de Klant.
2.1.6 Distributie vanaf een Server. Zoals wordt toegestaan in de Documentatie, mag de Klant een kopie
van de Software op een Computerbestandsserver binnen het Interne netwerk van de Klant (“Server”)
installeren ten behoeve van het downloaden en installeren van de Software op Computers binnen
hetzelfde Interne netwerk, enkel voor gebruik zoals toegestaan krachtens dit artikel 2.
2.1.7 Servergebruik.
2.1.7.1 Zoals wordt toegestaan in een afzonderlijk inkoopdocument of de Documentatie en conform
licentiebeperkingen in deze Overeenkomst, mag de klant de Software alleen op een Server installeren
om een persoon vanaf een Computer binnen hetzelfde Interne netwerk (“Netwerkgebruiker”) toegang
te bieden tot en gebruik te laten maken van de Software. De Netwerkgebruiker die toegang heeft tot
--- Page 80 ---
deze Software op de Server, wordt “Serversoftwaregebruiker” genoemd. Het totale aantal
Serversoftwaregebruiker (niet het aantal gelijktijdige gebruikers) mag niet hoger zijn dan het
Toegestane aantal. Als de Klant bijvoorbeeld tien licenties van de Software heeft aangeschaft (het
Toegestane aantal is tien) en ervoor kiest om de Software op een server te installeren, mag de Klant
slechts tien Serversoftwaregebruikers toegang tot de Software beiden (zelfs als de Klant mogelijk meer
dan tien Netwerkgebruikers of minder dan tien gelijktijdige gebruikers van de Software heeft).
2.1.7.2 Ter verduidelijking en zonder beperking: het voorgaande betekent niet dat de Klant de Software
mag installeren of openen (rechtstreeks of via opdrachten, data of instructies): (a) van of naar een
Computer die niet is aangesloten op het Interne netwerk van de Klant; (b) voor het mogelijk maken van
op het web gehoste werkgroepen of diensten die openbaar zijn; (c) door een persoon of entiteit die niet
gerechtigd is tot het gebruiken, downloaden, kopiëren of anderszins profiteren van de functionaliteit
van de Software middels een geldige licentie van Adobe; (d) als onderdeel van een systeem, workflow
of dienst welke toegankelijk is voor meer dan het Toegestane aantal gebruikers; of (e) voor
bewerkingen die niet door een individuele gebruiker zijn geïnitieerd (bijvoorbeeld geautomatiseerde
serververwerking).
2.2 Lidmaatschap. Dit artikel 2.2 is van toepassing op Klanten die een licentie of dienst met een
lidmaatschap hebben aangeschaft, zoals het lidmaatschap Creative Cloud (tezamen “Lidmaatschap”).
2.2.1 Onlinediensten van Adobe in verband met het Lidmaatschap. Op voorwaarde dat de Klant zich
doorlopend aan deze overeenkomst houdt en de bijbehorende abonnementskosten (indien van
toepassing) voldoet, verleent Adobe de Klant een niet-exclusief, in het hele Territorium geldend en
beperkt recht om de Software en de bijbehorende Onlinedienst van Adobe (zoals verder beschreven in
sectie 16.4.1) te openen en gebruiken als onderdeel van het Lidmaatschap, krachtens de voorwaarden
in deze Overeenkomst en de Aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden (zoals gedefinieerd in het
onderstaande artikel 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Softwarelicentie in verband met het Lidmaatschap. Op voorwaarde dat de Klant zich doorlopend
aan deze overeenkomst houdt en de bijbehorende abonnementskosten voldoet, verleent Adobe de
Klant een niet-exclusieve en beperkte licentie om de Software te installeren en gebruiken: (a) in het
Territorium, (b) gedurende de periode dat het Lidmaatschap huidig en actief is
(“Lidmaatschapstermijn”) en (c) conform de voorwaarden in deze overeenkomst en toepasselijke
Documentatie. Wanneer de Lidmaatschapstermijn is afgelopen of beëindigd, (x) is het zonder
voorafgaande kennisgeving mogelijk dat de Software geheel of gedeeltelijk niet langer werkt en (y) mag
de Klant de Software pas weer gebruiken wanneer de Klant het lidmaatschap verlengt. Alle
voorwaarden in deze overeenkomst in verband met de specifieke Software blijven van kracht en zijn
verder van toepassing op de Klant en het gebruik van deze Software.
2.2.3 Beperkingen. De Klant stemt in met de volgende aanvullende voorwaarden en beperkingen in
verband met het Lidmaatschap: (a) Adobe kan op elk gewenst moment het in het Lidmaatschap
opgenomen type Software kan wijzigen (zoals specifieke producten, onderdelen, versies, platforms,
talen en dergelijke) en jegens de Klant op generlei wijze aansprakelijk is voor een dergelijke wijziging;
(b) de Klant moet mogelijk op enig moment gedurende de Lidmaatschapstermijn verbinding maken
met internet en zich aanmelden; (c) de Software kan automatisch verbinding maken met internet om
op elk gewenst moment het Lidmaatschap van de Klant zonder kennisgeving te controleren; en (d) de
Klant mag anderen niet de mogelijkheid of toestemming geven om de Software als Klant te gebruiken.
2.3 Inhoudsbestanden. Tenzij anders is bepaald in de “Read-Me”-bestanden of andere licenties die bij
de Inhoudsbestanden behoren, mag de Klant alle Inhoudsbestanden weergeven, wijzigen, reproduceren
en verspreiden. De Klant mag echter de Inhoudsbestanden niet alleenstaand verspreiden (bijvoorbeeld
in omstandigheden waarin de Inhoudsbestanden de primaire waarde vertegenwoordigen van het
gedistribueerde product) en de Klant mag geen merkrechten doen gelden met betrekking tot de
Inhoudsbestanden of daaruit of daarvan afgeleide werken. Niets in deze overeenkomt is van invloed op
het eigendom van de Software zoals beschreven in artikel 3.

2.4 Voorbeeldapplicatiecode. De Klant mag de broncodevorm van delen van dergelijke
Softwareprogramma's die in de bijbehorende Documentatie nadrukkelijk als voorbeeldcode,
voorbeeldtoepassingscode, codefragmenten, ActionScript-klassenbestanden of voorbeeld onderdelen
(elk te noemen “Voorbeeldtoepassingscode”) worden geïdentificeerd, uitsluitend wijzigen ten behoeve
van het ontwerpen, ontwikkelen en testen van websites en toepassingen die met softwareprogramma's
van Adobe zijn ontwikkeld; echter onder de voorwaarde dat de Klant de (gewijzigde of ongewijzigde)
Voorbeeldapplicatiecode uitsluitend mag kopiëren en verspreiden als de Klant aan alle onderstaande
voorwaarden heeft voldaan: (a) de Klant verspreidt de gecompileerde objectcodeversies van de
Voorbeeldapplicatiecode alleen met uw applicatie; (b) de Klant neemt de Voorbeeldapplicatiecode niet
op in ontworpen producten of toepassingen die zijn ontworpen voor websiteontwikkeling; en (c) de
Klant gebruikt de naam, logo's of andere handelsmerken van Adobe niet om eigen toepassing te

gerechtelijke procedures, met inbegrip van advocaatkosten, ten gevolge van of in verband met het
gebruik of de distributie van de applicatie van de Klant.
2.5 Programmeertalen. De Software kan delen van de ExtendScript SDK en de Pixel Bender SDK
bevatten. Behoudens de beperkingen in dit artikel 2 verleent Adobe de Klant een niet-exclusieve, niet-
overdraagbare, royaltyvrije licentie voor het gebruik van de items in de ExtendScript SDK en de Pixel
Bender SDK, uitsluitend met het doel om applicatieprogramma's intern te ontwikkelen die ontworpen
zijn om met producten van Adobe te werken. Tenzij uitdrukkelijk vermeld in dit artikel 2.5, mogen geen
andere delen van de ExtendScript SDK of de Pixel Bender SDK worden gewijzigd of verspreid. De Klant
stemt ermee in Adobe te vrijwaren tegen verlies, schade, vorderingen en gerechtelijke procedures, met
inbegrip van advocaatkosten, die voortvloeien uit dergelijke verspreiding.
2.6 Kopieën van Documentatie. De Klant mag kopieën van de Documentatie maken voor eigen intern
gebruik in verband met het gebruik van de Software in overeenstemming met deze overeenkomst,
maar niet meer dan het redelijkerwijs noodzakelijke aantal.
3. Intellectuele eigendom.
De Software en alle toegestane kopieën die de Klant maakt, zijn de intellectuele eigendom van Adobe
Systems Incorporated en haar leveranciers. De structuur, organisatie en broncode van de Software
behoren tot de waardevolle handelsgeheimen en de vertrouwelijke informatie van Adobe Systems
Incorporated en haar leveranciers. De Software is wettelijk beschermd, met inbegrip van maar niet
beperkt tot de auteurswetten van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en andere landen en door
internationale verdragsbepalingen. Behalve zoals uitdrukkelijk in deze overeenkomst is vermeld,
worden op grond van deze overeenkomst aan de Klant geen intellectuele-eigendomsrechten op de
Software overgedragen. Alle rechten die niet uitdrukkelijk zijn verleend, zijn voorbehouden aan Adobe
en haar leveranciers.
4. Beperkingen en vereisten.
4.1 Aanduidingen van eigendom. Elke toegestane kopie van de Software (inclusief maar niet beperkt tot
Documentatie) die de Klant maakt, dient dezelfde auteursrechtelijke en overige vermeldingen van
eigendom te bevatten die op of in de Software worden weergegeven.
4.2 Verplichtingen door gebruik. De klant gaat ermee akkoord dat deze de Software niet op andere
wijze zal gebruiken dan zoals toegestaan door deze overeenkomst en dat de Klant de Software niet zal
gebruiken op een wijze die niet overeenstemt met het ontwerp en de Documentatie ervan.

4.4 Reverse-engineering niet toegestaan. Behoudens als toegestaan onder artikel 16.1 is het de Klant
niet toegestaan de broncode van de Software te decompileren, te disassembleren, aan reverse-
engineering te onderwerpen of op enige andere wijze proberen te achterhalen.
4.5 Loskoppeling niet toegestaan. De Software kan verschillende applicaties en onderdelen bevatten,
kan toegang tot verschillende Onlinediensten van Adobe toestaan, kan meerdere platforms en talen
ondersteunen en kan aan de Klant worden verstrekt op meerdere gegevensdragers of in de vorm van
meerdere exemplaren. Niettemin is de Software als één enkel product ontworpen en als zodanig aan de
Klant verstrekt, teneinde uitsluitend als één enkel product te worden gebruikt op Computers die zijn
toegestaan volgens deze overeenkomst. Tenzij anderszins is toegestaan in de Documentatie, is de Klant
niet verplicht alle onderdelen van de Software te installeren, maar de Klant mag de samenstellende
onderdelen van de Software niet afscheiden voor gebruik op verschillende Computers.
4.6 Overdracht niet toegestaan.
4.6.1 HET IS DE KLANT NIET TOEGESTAAN DE SOFTWARE OF ENIG DEEL DAARVAN TE VERHUREN, TE
VERKOPEN, IN LEASE OF IN SUBLICENTIE TE GEVEN (INCLUSIEF MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT SOFTWARE
DIE VIA HET WEB IS GEDOWNLOAD), OP DE COMPUTER VAN EEN DERDE PERSOON TE LATEN
KOPIËREN OF RECHTEN OP DE SOFTWARE AF TE STAAN OF OVER TE DRAGEN, TENZIJ DIT

waaronder de Klant een geldige licentie voor de Software heeft aangeschaft. Aanvullende informatie
over het overdragen van volumelicentiesoftware is beschikbaar op
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_nl.
4.6.3 Als er voor de Software terugkerende activering of registratie vereist is en Adobe het verzoek van
de Klant te worden vrijgesteld van de vereiste van deze terugkerende activering of registratie honoreert,
gelden niet alleen de beperkingen in de Activeringsvoorwaarden (zoals gedefinieerd in artikel 14.3),
maar wordt ook het recht om de Software permanent over te dragen (zoals beschreven in artikel 4.6.2)
direct beëindigd zodra het verzoek is toegekend.
4.7 Servicebureau niet toegestaan. De klant mag de software niet gebruiken of aanbieden op basis van
een servicebureau. Artikel 16.6.3 bevat een beperkte uitzondering voor alleen fontsoftware.
4.8 Beperkingen voor Adobe Runtime. De klant mag Adobe Runtimes niet gebruiken op een apparaat
dat geen pc is, of met enige ingebouwde of apparaatversie van een besturingssysteem. Om
misverstanden te voorkomen en slechts ter illustratie: de Klant mag Adobe Runtimes niet gebruiken op
(a) mobiele apparaten, settopboxen (STB), draagbare apparaten ('handhelds'), telefoons, gameconsoles,
televisies, dvd-spelers, mediacentra (behalve Windows XP Media Center Edition en diens opvolgers),
elektronische billboards of andere digitale borden, internettoepassingen of andere aan internet

4.9 Territorium. De Klant dient de Software alleen te gebruiken en toegang tot Onlinediensten van
Adobe alleen te verkrijgen in het Territorium en op een wijze die overeenkomt met het
activeringsbeleid zoals beschreven op http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_nl. Adobe kan de in deze
overeenkomst verleende licentie beëindigen of het Lidmaatschap of de toegang tot de Onlinediensten
van Adobe opschorten als door Adobe wordt vastgesteld dat de Klant de Software of Onlinediensten
van Adobe buiten het Territorium gebruikt.
5. Updates.
Als de Software een Update voor een eerdere versie van Adobse-software (de “Eerdere versie”) is, dan
mag de Klant deze Update alleen gebruiken wanneer deze de Eerdere versie bewaart. Als de Klant
derhalve deze Update op een geldige manier overbrengt overeenkomstig artikel 4.6, moet de Klant de
Eerdere versie tegelijkertijd overbrengen. Als de Klant deze Update wil gebruiken naast de Eerdere
versie, mag de Klant dit alleen doen op dezelfde Computer waarop de Eerdere versie is geïnstalleerd en
gebruikt. Zodra deze Update beschikbaar is, is Adobe mogelijk niet langer verplicht om Eerdere versies
gedurende de Licentietermijn te ondersteunen. De Update mag niet op een andere manier worden
gebruikt. Aanvullende updates kunnen in licentie aan de Klant worden verstrekt door Adobe met
aanvullende of andere voorwaarden.
6. Beperkte garantie.
Tenzij anders is aangegeven in een afzonderlijke overeenkomst tussen Adobe en een licentienemer
voor de Software, garandeert Adobe aan de natuurlijke of rechtspersoon die het eerst een licentie voor
de Software heeft verworven voor gebruik op grond van de voorwaarden van deze overeenkomst, dat
de Software in hoofdzaak in overeenstemming met de bijhorende gebruikershandleiding voor de
Software zal functioneren gedurende (a) de periode van negentig (90) dagen of, indien deze periode
korter is, (b) de Licentietermijn na ontvangst van de Software (“Garantieperiode”), wanneer deze wordt
gebruikt op de Compatibele computer. Niet-wezenlijke variaties in de prestaties in vergelijking met
hetgeen is beschreven in de gebruikershandleiding gelden niet als recht om aanspraak te maken op de
garantie. Deze beperkte garantie is niet van toepassing op de volgende items, welke als zodanig (“AS
IS”) en zonder garantie van Adobe beschikbaar worden gesteld: (i) patches (ii) fontsoftware,
(iii) Prereleasesoftware, proef-, starter- en evaluatieversie, productvoorbeeld, Evaluatiesoftware en niet
voor wederverkoop bestemde exemplaren van Software; (iv) websites, Onlinediensten van Adobe,
Onlinediensten van derden; (v) gecertificeerde documentdiensten (zie Artikel 16) en alle software die
door Adobe beschikbaar wordt gesteld om gratis via een Adobe-website gedownload te worden.
Teneinde aanspraak te kunnen maken op de garantie, dient de Klant de Software, vergezeld van een
bewijs van aankoop, aan de afdeling Customer Support van Adobe te retourneren. Aanvullende
informatie over garantieclaims is beschikbaar op http://www.adobe.com/go/support_nl. De gehele
aansprakelijkheid van Adobe en de aan haar gelieerde vennootschappen in verband met deze
garantieclaim alsmede de exclusieve verhaalsmogelijkheid en het uitsluitende recht uit hoofde van de
garantie wordt beperkt, ter keuze van Adobe, tot ondersteuning van de Software op basis van de
garantieclaim, tot vervanging van de Software of, indien ondersteuning of vervanging naar oordeel van
Adobe niet praktisch is, tot restitutie van de licentievergoeding die de Klant voor de Software heeft
betaald (indien van toepassing). DE IN DIT ARTIKEL BESCHREVEN BEPERKTE GARANTIE GEEFT DE
KLANT SPECIFIEKE RECHTEN. DE KLANT KAN OOK ANDERE RECHTEN HEBBEN, AFHANKELIJK VAN DE
GELDENDE WETGEVING IN HET RECHTSGEBIED WAAR DE KLANT IS GEVESTIGD. ADOBE PROBEERT
DE GARANTIERECHTEN VAN DE KLANT NIET TE BEPERKEN VOOR ZOVER DAT NIET WETTELIJK IS
TOEGESTAAN. Zie artikel 16 voor meer informatie over bepalingen met betrekking tot specifieke
rechtsgebieden of neem contact op met de klantenservice van Adobe.

INTEGRATIE, VERHANDELBAARHEID, ONGESTOORD GENOT, BEVREDIGENDE KWALITEIT OF
GESCHIKTHEID VOOR EEN SPECIFIEK DOEL. BEHOUDENS DE AANGEBODEN EN WETTELIJK VEREISTE
GARANTIES EN RECHTSMIDDELEN, WORDEN DE SOFTWARE EN TOEGANG TOT ALLE WEBSITES,
ONLINE DIENSTEN VAN ADOBE OF DERDEN, EN DIENSTEN VAN CERTIFICERENDE INSTANTIES ALS
ZODANIG (AS-IS) EN MET ALLE FOUTEN GELEVERD. DEZE UITSLUITING VAN DE GARANTIE IS
MOGELIJK NIET GELDIG IN BEPAALDE RECHTSGEBIEDEN. DE KLANT HEEFT WELLICHT NOG
AANVULLENDE WETTELIJKE GARANTIERECHTEN DIE NIET MOGEN WORDEN AFGEWEZEN OF
UITGESLOTEN. ADOBE PROBEERT DE GARANTIERECHTEN VAN DE KLANT NIET TE BEPERKEN VOOR
ZOVER DAT NIET WETTELIJK IS TOEGESTAAN. De bepalingen van artikel 7 en 8 blijven ook na
beëindiging van deze overeenkomst gelden, ongeacht de oorzaak van deze beëindiging, maar hierdoor
wordt geen recht geïmpliceerd of in het leven geroepen tot verder gebruik van de Software na
beëindiging van deze overeenkomst.
8. Beperking van aansprakelijkheid.
BEHOUDENS HET HIERBOVEN VERMELDE EXCLUSIEVE RECHTSMIDDEL DAT WORDT AANGEBODEN
DOOR ADOBE EN EVENTUELE RECHTSMIDDELEN DIE NIET WETTELIJK KUNNEN WORDEN

WEZENLIJKE SCHENDING DAN WEL EEN SCHENDING VAN DE FUNDAMENTELE OF WEZENLIJKE
VOORWAARDEN VAN DEZE OVEREENKOMST. Niets in deze Overeenkomst dient te worden opgevat
als een beperking van de aansprakelijkheid van Adobe jegens de Klant in geval van overlijden of
persoonlijk letsel ten gevolge van nalatigheid of bedrog (fraude) door Adobe. Adobe treedt op namens
de aan haar gelieerde vennootschappen, leveranciers en Certificerende Instanties waar het de afwijzing,
uitsluiting en/of beperking van verplichtingen, garanties en aansprakelijkheid betreft, doch niet voor wat
betreft andere zaken of doeleinden.

ZIJN TOEGESTAAN DOOR DE TOEPASSELIJKE WETGEVING IN HET RECHTSGEBIED VAN DE KLANT.
DEZE BEPERKING VAN DE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID IS MOGELIJK NIET GELDIG IN BEPAALDE
RECHTSGEBIEDEN. DE KLANT HEEFT WELLICHT NOG RECHTEN DIE KRACHTENS WETTEN VOOR

VERKLARINGEN MET BETREKKING TOT SPECIFIEKE RECHTSGEBIEDEN.
9. Exportregels.
De Klant erkent dat de Software onder de Amerikaanse regelgeving inzake exportbeheer (de “EAR”,
Export Administration Regulations) valt en dat de Klant deze regelgeving zal naleven. De Klant mag de
Software niet direct of indirect exporteren of herexporteren naar: (a) landen die vallen onder de
Amerikaanse exportbeperkingen (inclusief maar niet beperkt tot Cuba, Iran, Noord-Korea, Sudan en
Syrië); (b) eindgebruikers van wie de Klant weet of vermoedt dat ze de Software zullen gebruiken bij het
ontwerpen, ontwikkelen of produceren van nucleaire, chemische of biologische wapens, raketsystemen,
ruimtevaartuigen, ruimtesondes of onbemande luchtvaartuigen; of (c) eindgebruikers die zijn
uitgesloten van deelname aan de Amerikaanse exporttransacties door enige federale instantie van de
Amerikaanse overheid. Daarnaast is de Klant verantwoordelijk voor naleving van lokale wetgeving in
het rechtsgebied van de Klant die invloed kan hebben op het recht van de Klant om de Software te
importeren, exporteren of gebruiken. Als Adobe kennis ervan heeft genomen dat er een overtreding is
begaan, mag Adobe mogelijk geen onderhoud en ondersteuning meer bieden voor de Software.
10. Toepasselijk recht.
Als de Klant een consument is die de Software uitsluitend voor persoonlijke, niet-zakelijke doeleinden
gebruikt, valt deze overeenkomst onder de wetgeving van het rechtsgebied waarin de Klant de licentie
voor het gebruik van de Software heeft aangeschaft. Als de Klant geen dergelijke consument is, valt
deze overeenkomst onder en zal deze worden uitgelegd in overeenstemming met het van kracht zijnde
recht in: (a) in de staat Californië, indien een licentie voor de Software wordt verkregen als de Klant in
de Verenigde Staten, Canada of Mexico verblijft; of (b) in Japan, indien een licentie voor de Software
wordt verkregen als de Klant in Japan verblijft; of (c) Singapore, indien een licentie voor de Software
wordt verkregen als de Klant in een lidstaat van de Associatie van Zuidoost-Aziatische landen, het
vasteland van China, Hongkong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan of Zuid-Korea verblijft; of (d) in Engeland en
Wales, indien een licentie voor de Software wordt verkregen als de Klant in een ander rechtsgebied
verblijft dan hierboven is beschreven. De respectieve rechtbanken van Santa Clara County, Californië,
indien Californisch recht van toepassing is, Tokyo District Court in Japan, indien Japans recht van
toepassing is, en de bevoegde rechtbanken in Londen, Engeland en Wales, indien Engels recht van
toepassing is, hebben elk niet-exclusieve rechtsbevoegdheid met betrekking tot alle geschillen
betreffende of gerelateerd aan deze overeenkomst. Wanneer de wetgeving van Singapore van
toepassing is, zal elk geschil ten gevolge van of in verband met deze overeenkomst, inclusief elke
kwestie betreffende het bestaan, de geldigheid of de beëindiging, worden voorgelegd aan en definitief
worden opgelost door een bemiddelaar in Singapore overeenkomstig de arbitrageregels van de
Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) zolang deze gezag heeft. Deze regels worden bij
verwijzing geacht te zijn opgenomen in dit artikel. Er is slechts één bemiddelaar, die gezamenlijk wordt
geselecteerd door de partijen. Als de bemiddelaar niet binnen dertig (30) dagen na het schriftelijke
verzoek tot bemiddeling door een partij is geselecteerd, zal de voorzitter van de SIAC de keuze maken.
De bemiddeling zal plaatsvinden in het Engels. Onverminderd enige bepaling in deze overeenkomst
kan enige juridische, administratieve of andere autoriteit door Adobe of de Klant worden verzocht om
een voorlopige of verduurzamende maatregel te treffen, inclusief dwangmiddelen, specifieke prestaties
of andere soortgelijke middelen, voorafgaand aan de inwerkingstelling van juridische of arbitraire
procedures of gedurende de procedures, voor het behoud van rechten en belangen van Adobe of de
Klant of om specifieke voorwaarden af te dwingen die geschikt zijn voor tijdelijke rechtsmiddelen. Deze
overeenkomst is niet onderworpen aan het volgende, waarvan de toepassing hierbij dan ook expliciet is
uitgesloten. (x) conflictregels van welk rechtsgebied dan ook, (y) het Verdrag der Verenigde Naties
inzake internationale koopovereenkomsten betreffende roerende zaken, en (z) de uniforme wet voor
computerinformatietransacties, zoals bepaald in welk rechtsgebied dan ook.

11. Algemene bepalingen.
Als enig onderdeel van deze overeenkomst ongeldig, niet bindend en/of niet afdwingbaar blijkt, heeft
dit geen effect op de geldigheid van de rest van deze Overeenkomst, die geldig, bindend en
afdwingbaar blijft onder de van toepassing zijnde bepalingen. Deze overeenkomst kan alleen worden
gewijzigd via een schrijven dat is ondertekend door een daartoe bevoegde vertegenwoordiger van
Adobe. De Engelse versie van deze overeenkomst zal worden gebruikt wanneer deze Overeenkomst
moet worden geïnterpreteerd of uitgelegd. Dit is de gehele overeenkomst tussen Adobe en de Klant
met betrekking tot de software en deze overeenkomst treedt in de plaats van alle voorgaande
verklaringen, besprekingen, toezeggingen, mededelingen of reclame met betrekking tot de software.
12. Kennisgeving aan eindgebruikers binnen de Amerikaanse overheid.
12.1 Licentie van Adobe-technologie voor de Amerikaanse overheid. De Klant stemt ermee in dat
wanneer de Klant Software van Adobe in licentie geeft voor verwerving door de Amerikaanse overheid
of enige andere opdrachtnemer voor deze, de Klant dat zal doen in overeenstemming met het beleid
dat is uiteengezet in 48 C.F.R. Artikel 12.212 (voor burgerlijke bureaus) en 48 C.F.R. Artikel 227.7202-1
en Artikel 227.7202-4 (voor het Ministerie van Defensie). Met betrekking tot eindgebruikers binnen de
overheid van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika zal Adobe voldoen aan de toepasselijke wetgeving met
betrekking tot gelijke rechten, inclusief, indien van toepassing, de bepalingen van Executive
Order 11246, zoals geamendeerd, artikel 402 van de Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance
Act van 1974 (38 USC 4212) en artikel 503 van de Rehabilitation Act van 1973, zoals geamendeerd, en
de voorschriften van 41 CFR Parts 60-1 t/m 60-60, 60-250 en 60-741. De in de voorgaande zin
ingesloten clausule en voorschriften met betrekking tot positieve discriminatie worden geacht met deze
verwijzing te zijn opgenomen in deze overeenkomst.
12.2 Commercial Items. Voor eindgebruikers binnen de overheid van de VS zijn de software en de
documentatie “Commercial Items” (commerciële artikelen), zoals gedefinieerd in 48 C.F.R. artikel 2.101,
en omvatten “Commercial Computer Software” (commerciële computersoftware) en “Commercial
Computer Software Documentation” (documentatie bij commerciële computersoftware) zoals deze
termen worden gebruikt in 48 C.F.R. artikel 12.212 respectievelijk 48 C.F.R. artikel 227.7202.
Overeenkomstig respectievelijk 48 CFR artikel 12.212 en 48 CFR artikel 227.7202-1 t/m 227.7202-4
worden de “Commercial Computer Software” en “Commercial Computer Software Documentation” in
licentie verstrekt aan eindgebruikers binnen de overheid van de VS (a) uitsluitend als “Commercial
Items” en (b) uitsluitend met die rechten die aan alle andere eindgebruikers worden verleend uit hoofde
van de voorwaarden van deze overeenkomst. Rechten op niet-gepubliceerde werken worden
voorbehouden krachtens de auteurswetten van de Verenigde Staten.
13. Naleving van licenties.
Indien de Klant een bedrijf of organisatie is, stemt de Klant ermee in dat Adobe of haar bevoegde
vertegenwoordiger, naast eventuele door de Software uitgevoerde controles op naleving van licenties,
binnen zeven (7) werkdagen na kennisgeving records, systemen en faciliteiten van de Klant maximaal
eenmaal per twaalf (12) maanden mag inspecteren om te controleren of de Klant alle software en
diensten van Adobe gebruikt in overeenstemming met uw geldige licenties van Adobe. Adobe heeft
bijvoorbeeld het recht op records van de Klant die nuttig zijn om te bepalen of installaties van de
Software een serienummer hebben. De Klant dient dergelijke records onmiddellijk na verzoek van
Adobe aan Adobe te verstrekken. Bovendien dient de Klant aan Adobe alle records en gegevens te
verstrekken waarom Adobe verzoekt teneinde te controleren of het gebruik van enige en alle software
van Adobe door de Kant voldoet aan diens geldige licenties van Adobe binnen dertig (30) dagen na het
verzoek van Adobe. Aanvullende informatie over serienummers is beschikbaar op

14. Internetconnectiviteit en privacy.
14.1 Automatische verbinding met internet. De Software kan zonder kennisgeving automatisch vanaf de
Computer van de Klant verbinding met internet maken en communiceren met een website of domein
van Adobe teneinde onder andere licenties te valideren en de Klant aanvullende informatie, functies en
opties te verschaffen. Tenzij anderszins is vermeld in artikel 14.2 tot en met 14.7, zijn de volgende
bepalingen van toepassing op alle automatische verbindingen die de Software met internet maakt.
14.1.1 Wanneer de software verbinding maakt met internet en met een Adobe-website communiceert,
is het Privacybeleid van kracht, ongeacht of de verbinding automatisch of op uw uitdrukkelijke verzoek
tot stand is gekomen. Het Privacybeleid van Adobe staat het bijhouden van websitebezoek toe en
beschrijft welke activiteiten worden bijgehouden en hoe cookies, webbakens en vergelijkbare middelen
worden toegepast.
14.1.2 Zodra de Software verbinding met Adobe maakt via internet, worden bepaalde gegevens van de
Klant door de Software verzameld en verzonden naar Adobe conform het beleid voor onlineprivacy van
Adobe, dat beschikbaar is op http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_nl (“Privacybeleid”).
14.1.3 Als de Klant zich toegang verschaft tot een Onlinedienst van Adobe (zoals gedefinieerd in
artikel 16.4 hieronder) of de Software activeert of registreert, kunnen aanvullende gegevens zoals de
Adobe-ID, de gebruikersnaam en het wachtwoord van de Klant worden verzonden naar en opgeslagen
door Adobe conform het Privacybeleid en aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden in verband met deze
Onlinedienst van Adobe (tezamen met de gebruiksvoorwaarden van Adobe.com en alle toepasselijke
voorwaarden de “Aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden”).
14.1.4 Voor zover toegestaan door de toepasselijke wetgeving of met instemming van de Klant kan
Adobe (a) berichten over transacties naar de Klant verzenden teneinde de Onlinedienst van Adobe of
de activering of registratie van de Software of de Onlinedienst van Adobe te bespoedigen, of (b) in het
product marketingboodschappen weergeven om informatie te verstrekken over de Software en andere
producten en diensten van Adobe, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot de platformversie, versie van de
Software, licentiestatus en taal.
14.2 Updates. De Software kan ervoor zorgen dat de Computer van de Klant zonder voorafgaande
kennisgeving automatisch verbinding maakt met internet (op een periodieke of regelmatige basis) om
(a) te controleren of er Updates beschikbaar zijn om te downloaden naar en te installeren op de
Computer en (b) Adobe de resultaten van installatiepogingen door te geven.
14.3 Activering. De Software kan de Klant verplichten om (a) een Adobe-ID te verkrijgen, (b) de
Software te activeren of opnieuw te activeren, (c) de Software te registreren of (d) het Lidmaatschap te
valideren. Vanwege deze vereiste is het mogelijk dat de Computer van de Klant zonder kennisgeving
verbinding maken met internet tijdens de installatie, bij het starten en op een periodieke of regelmatige
basis daarna. Nadat de Software verbinding heeft gemaakt, worden gegevens verzameld en verzonden
naar Adobe, zoals verder beschreven op http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_nl
(“Activeringsvoorwaarden”). De Software of de Klant kan ook gegevens van Adobe ontvangen over de
licentie, het abonnement of het Lidmaatschap van de Klant. Adobe kan dergelijke gegevens gebruiken
om frauduleus of ongeautoriseerd gebruik te detecteren of voorkomen welke in strijd is met een
geldige licentie, een geldig abonnement of een geldig Lidmaatschap. Wanneer de Software niet wordt
geactiveerd of geregistreerd, het abonnement of het Lidmaatschap niet wordt gevalideerd of Adobe
vaststelt dat de Software op frauduleuze of ongeautoriseerde wijze wordt gebruikt, kan dit ertoe leiden
dat minder functionaliteit beschikbaar is, de Software niet werkt of het abonnement of het
Lidmaatschap wordt beëindigd of opgeschort.
14.4 Deactivering. De Klant kan de Software op de computer deactiveren en verwijderen teneinde de
Software op een andere Computer te installeren en activeren overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst
(“Deactivering”) en zoals verder wordt beschreven in http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_nl. Voor
Deactivering is internetconnectiviteit vereist.
--- Page 88 ---
14.5 Gebruik van Onlinediensten. De Software kan ervoor zorgen dat de Computer van de Klant zonder
voorafgaande kennisgeving automatisch verbinding maakt met internet om de Klant gemakkelijker
toegang te verlenen tot inhoud en diensten die de Klant ter beschikking worden gesteld door Adobe of
derden, zoals verder beschreven in artikel 16.4 (Onlinediensten). Bovendien kan de Software zonder
voorafgaande kennisgeving automatisch verbinding maken met internet om downloadbaar materiaal
bij te werken vanaf deze onlinediensten, zodat deze diensten zelfs als de Klant offline is onmiddellijk
beschikbaar zijn.
14.6 Digitale certificaten. De Software gebruikt digitale certificaten (zoals beschreven in artikel 16.5) om
de Klant te helpen bij het identificeren van gedownloade bestanden (bijvoorbeeld toepassingen en
inhoud) en de uitgevers van die bestanden. Adobe AIR gebruikt bijvoorbeeld digitale certificaten om de
Klant te helpen bij het bepalen van de uitgever van Adobe AIR-applicaties. In de Adobe Acrobat-
productlijn worden ook digitale certificaten gebruikt om PDF-documenten (Portable Document Format)
te ondertekenen en valideren en om gecertificeerde PDF-documenten te valideren. De Computer van
de Klant maakt mogelijk verbinding met internet op het moment dat een digitaal certificaat wordt
gecontroleerd.
14.7 Instellingenbeheer. De Software bevat mogelijk Flash Player. Flash Player kan bepaalde
gebruikersinstellingen opslaan op de Computer van de Klant als lokaal gedeeld object. Ze zijn
gekoppeld aan het exemplaar van Flash Player op de Computer, zodat de klant runtimefuncties kan
aanpassen. Met instellingenbeheer voor Flash Player kan de Klant dergelijke instellingen aanpassen. Zo
kan de Klant het opslaan van lokale gedeelde objecten door derden beperken of inhoud van derden
het recht op toegang tot de microfoon en camera van de computer verlenen. Aanvullende informatie
over het configureren van instellingen van de versie van Flash Player, zoals het uitschakelen van lokale
gedeelde objecten met behulp van instellingenbeheer voor Flash Player, is beschikbaar op
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_nl. Aanvullende informatie over lokale gedeelde objecten
is beschikbaar op http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_nl.
15. Peer-to-peer-communicatie.
De Software kan zonder voorafgaande kennisgeving de verbinding van de Klant met een LAN-netwerk
gebruiken om automatisch verbinding te maken met andere software van Adobe en kan daarbij in het
LAN-netwerk aangeven dat de Software beschikbaar is voor communicatie met andere software van
Adobe. Deze verbindingen kunnen het IP-adres van verbinding van de Klant naar het LAN-netwerk
verzenden.
16. Bijzondere bepalingen en uitzonderingen.
In dit artikel worden zowel specifieke bepalingen die verband houden met bepaalde producten en
onderdelen van de Software als beperkte uitzonderingen op de bovengenoemde bepalingen en
voorwaarden vermeld. Voor zover een bepaling in dit artikel in strijd is met een andere bepaling of
voorwaarde in deze Overeenkomst treden de voorwaarden in dit artikel in de plaats van een dergelijke
andere bepaling of voorwaarde.
16.1 Geen afbreuk; bepalingen van de Europese Economische Ruimte; verplichte kennisgeving voor
Australië.
16.1.1 Deze overeenkomst doet geen afbreuk aan de wettelijke rechten van partijen, inclusief partijen
die handelen als consument. Zo geldt bijvoorbeeld voor consumenten in Nieuw-Zeeland die de
Software voor persoonlijk of huishoudelijk gebruik (niet voor zakelijke doeleinden) hebben
aangeschaft, dat deze overeenkomst is onderworpen aan de Consumer Guarantees Act (wet inzake
garanties voor consumenten).
--- Page 89 ---
16.1.2 Als de Klant de Software in de Europese Economische Ruimte (EER) heeft verkregen, de Klant
normaal gesproken de verblijfplaats in de EER heeft en de Klant een consument is (de Klant gebruikt
dus de Software voor persoonlijke, niet-zakelijke doeleinden), is artikel 6 (Beperkte garantie) niet op de
aankoop en het gebruik van de Software door de Klant van toepassing. In plaats hiervan garandeert
Adobe voor een periode van twee (2) jaar vanaf de datum van aankoop dat de Software de
functionaliteit biedt die is beschreven in de toepasselijke gebruikershandleiding (de “overeengekomen
functionaliteit”), wanneer deze wordt gebruikt op de Compatibele computer. Aan niet-wezenlijke
afwijkingen van de overeengekomen functionaliteit kunnen geen garantierechten worden ontleend.
DEZE GARANTIE IS NIET VAN TOEPASSING OP SOFTWARE DIE DE KLANT GEBRUIKT ALS
PRERELEASE-, TEST-, STARTER- OF PROEFVERSIE, OP FONTSOFTWARE OF OP DE MATE WAARIN DE
SOFTWARE NIET FUNCTIONEERT OMDAT DE KLANT WIJZIGINGEN HEEFT AANGEBRACHT. Als de
Klant aanspraak wil maken op de garantie, dient de Klant dit te melden bij de klantenservice van Adobe
binnen deze periode van twee (2) jaar en daarbij het aankoopbewijs van de Software te overleggen.
Adobe controleert dan of er een fout in de Software bestaat of informeert de Klant dat de fout zich
voordoet omdat de Klant de Software niet juist heeft geïnstalleerd. (In dit geval zal Adobe de Klant hulp
verlenen.) Als de Software een fout bevat, kan de Klant een verzoek tot terugbetaling indienen bij
Adobe of een hersteld of vervangend exemplaar van de Software vragen. Het aankoopbewijs dient bij
de verzoeken te worden overgelegd. Indien de garantieaanspraken van de Klant gefundeerd zijn, komt
Adobe tegemoet aan het verzoek van de Klant tot een hersteld of vervangend exemplaar van de
Software, tenzij dit niet redelijk is voor Adobe. In dat geval ontvangt de Klant een terugbetaling van
Adobe. Neem voor hulp bij de garantie contact op met de klantenservice van Adobe.
De bepalingen van artikel 8 (Beperking van aansprakelijkheid) blijven van kracht voor
schadevorderingen die de Klant maakt met betrekking tot diens gebruik van de Software. Adobe is
echter aansprakelijk voor directe verliezen die redelijkerwijs hadden kunnen worden voorzien ingeval
Adobe deze Overeenkomst niet nakomt. De Klant wordt aangeraden alle redelijke maatregelen te
nemen om schade te vermijden of verminderen, in het bijzonder door een back-up van de Software en
de computergegevens te maken.
Deze overeenkomst, en in het bijzonder dit artikel 16.1.2, is bedoeld om de rechten van de Klant te
beschrijven (inclusief de dwingendrechtelijke rechten van de Klant) in het geval er problemen zijn met
het gebruik van de Software door de Klant. Indien de Klant meer wettelijke rechten heeft dan deze
beschrijving, zijn de wettelijke rechten van de Klant van toepassing.
16.1.3 Niets in deze Overeenkomst (met inbegrip van artikel 4.4) beperkt enig niet voor afstand vatbaar
recht om de Software te decompileren dat de Klant mogelijk geniet onder toepasselijk recht. Als de
Klant bijvoorbeeld in de Europese Unie (EU) is gevestigd, kan de Klant onder bepaalde, in het
toepasselijk recht vastgelegde voorwaarden het recht hebben om de Software te decompileren
wanneer dit nodig is om interoperabiliteit van de Software met een ander softwareprogramma te
realiseren en de Klant eerst Adobe schriftelijk heeft verzocht de benodigde informatie te verstrekken
om dergelijke operabiliteit te bereiken en Adobe zulke informatie niet beschikbaar heeft gesteld.
Bovendien mag een dergelijke decompilatie alleen worden uitgevoerd door de Klant of iemand anders
die het recht heeft om een exemplaar van de Software namens de Klant te gebruiken. Adobe heeft het
recht om redelijke voorwaarden op te leggen voordat dergelijke informatie wordt verstrekt. Alle door
Adobe verstrekte of door de Klant verkregen informatie, zoals hieronder toegestaan, mag alleen door
de Klant worden gebruikt voor doeleinden zoals hierin beschreven en mag niet bekend worden
gemaakt aan derden, worden gebruikt om software te maken die grotendeels gelijk is aan de Software
van Adobe of worden gebruikt voor andere handelingen die inbreuk maken op het auteursrecht van
Adobe of haar licentieverleners.
16.1.4 Als de Klant de Software in Australië verkrijgt, is de volgende bepaling van toepassing,
niettegenstaande enige andersluidende in deze overeenkomst opgenomen bepalingen:
--- Page 90 ---
KENNISGEVING AAN CONSUMENTEN IN AUSTRALIË:
Goederen van Adobe worden geleverd met garanties die niet kunnen worden uitgesloten volgens de
Australische Consumers Law (consumentenwet). U hebt recht op vervanging of terugbetaling bij
ernstige fouten en op vergoeding bij verlies dat of schade die redelijkerwijs had kunnen worden
voorzien. U hebt tevens recht op herstel of vervanging van de goederen als de goederen niet van een
acceptabele kwaliteit zijn en de fout niet overeenkomt met een ernstige fout. Softwareproducten van
Adobe worden tevens geleverd met een beperkte garantie van 90 dagen die wordt uitgegeven door
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, gevestigd aan 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus,
Dublin 24, Ireland, zoals uiteengezet in de Overeenkomst. Als het product binnen de periode van
90 dagen nadat het aan u is geleverd niet de algemene opties en functies biedt die in de
gebruikersdocumentatie zijn beschreven, belt u met de klantenservice van Adobe in de VS op
1800 614 863 en overlegt u de productdetails, het serienummer en het aankoopbewijs. Van u kan
worden verlangd dat u het softwareproduct retourneert naar het op dat moment door Adobe verstrekte
adres. In dit geval is een dergelijke retournering op uw eigen kosten. De voordelen onder deze garantie
vormen een aanvulling op de andere rechten en rechtsmiddelen die u bij wet hebt.
16.2 Aanvullende voorwaarden voor Prereleasesoftware. Indien de Software een precommerciële versie
of bètasoftware (“Prereleasesoftware”) is, is dit artikel van toepassing. Prereleasesoftware is een
prereleaseversie en geen eindproduct van Adobe en kan bugs, fouten en andere problemen bevatten
die mogelijk tot systeem- of andere fouten en gegevensverlies kunnen leiden. Adobe mag de
Prerelease-software nooit commercieel uitbrengen. Indien de Klant de Prereleasesoftware heeft
ontvangen ingevolge een afzonderlijke schriftelijke overeenkomst, zoals de licentieovereenkomst van
Adobe Systems voor Prereleasesoftware, is het gebruik van de Software door de Klant tevens
onderworpen aan de bepalingen van een dergelijke overeenkomst. De Klant dient direct alle
Prereleasesoftware te retourneren of vernietigen op verzoek van Adobe of bij de commerciële release
van de Software. DE KLANT GEBRUIKT PRERELEASESOFTWARE OP EIGEN RISICO. ZIE ARTIKEL 6 EN 8
VOOR BEPERKTE GARANTIE EN AANSPRAKELIJKHEIDSBEPERKINGEN DIE OP PRERELEASESOFTWARE
VAN TOEPASSING ZIJN.
16.3 Educatieve softwareproducten. Indien de Software educatieve software is (software die is
vervaardigd en verspreid voor gebruik door uitsluitend educatieve eindgebruikers), mag de Klant de
Software alleen gebruiken als de Klant in het eigen rechtsgebied is gekwalificeerd als educatieve
eindgebruiker. Ga naar http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_nl voor meer informatie over
voorwaarden. Ga naar http://www.adobe.com/go/store_nl en klik op de koppeling voor de wereldwijde
aanschaf van Adobe-producten om te zoeken naar een bevoegde leverancier van academische Adobe-
producten.
16.4 Onlinediensten.
16.4.1 Aangeboden door Adobe. De Software vergemakkelijkt de toegang van de Klant tot inhoud en
verschillende diensten die worden gehost op door Adobe of de aan haar gelieerde vennootschappen
onderhouden websites (“Onlinediensten van Adobe”). Voorbeelden van dergelijke Onlinediensten van
Adobe zijn: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite,
Acrobat.com, Search for Help en welkomstschermen van producten. In sommige gevallen kan een
Onlinedienst van Adobe als functie of uitbreiding binnen de Software worden weergegeven, hoewel de
dienst op een website wordt gehost. Voor toegang tot een Onlinedienst van Adobe moet de Klant
mogelijk de Software activeren, een Adobe-ID verkrijgen, de Aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden
accepteren of afzonderlijke kosten voldoen om toegang te krijgen tot dergelijke Onlinediensten van
Adobe. De Onlinediensten van Adobe zijn mogelijk niet in alle talen of voor de inwoners van alle
landen beschikbaar en Adobe kan, op elk gewenst moment en ongeacht de reden, de beschikbaarheid
van een Onlinedienst van Adobe wijzigen of staken. Adobe behoudt zich ook het recht voor om kosten
in rekening te gaan brengen voor toegang of gebruik van een Onlinedienst van Adobe die voorheen
gratis werd aangeboden. Artikel 14 bevat belangrijke informatie over internetconnectiviteit en privacy
van de Klant. Zoals in artikel 14 wordt vermeld, is het gebruik van Onlinediensten van Adobe door de
Klant, wanneer de software toegang zoekt tot een Onlinedienst van Adobe, vastgelegd in het
--- Page 91 ---
Privacybeleid van Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_nl), in de Gebruiksvoorwaarden van
Adobe.com (http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_nl) en in alle Aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden die de
Klant op dat moment kunnen worden voorgelegd.
16.4.2 Aangeboden door derden. De Software kan de Klant toegang vergemakkelijken tot websites die
worden onderhouden door derde aanbieders van artikelen, informatie, software en diensten
(“Onlinedienst(en) van derden”). Een voorbeeld van dergelijke Onlinediensten van derden is de service
Kodak EasyShare Gallery. Het toegang tot en gebruik van alle Onlinediensten van derden door de Klant
is vastgelegd in de bepalingen, voorwaarden, afwijzingen en vermeldingen die op een dergelijke site
staan vermeld of anderszins aan dergelijke Onlinediensten van derden zijn verbonden. Adobe heeft
geen zeggenschap, hecht geen goedkeuring aan en accepteert geen verantwoordelijkheid voor
Onlinediensten van derden. Eventuele transacties tussen de Klant en een derde in verband met een
Onlinedienst van derden, met inbegrip van het privacybeleid van een dergelijke derde, het gebruik van
persoonlijke gegevens van de Klant, de levering van en betaling voor goederen en diensten evenals
eventuele andere voorwaarden, bepalingen, garanties of verklaringen in verband met dergelijke
transacties, geschieden uitsluitend tussen de Klant en een dergelijke derde. De Onlinediensten van
derden zijn mogelijk niet in alle talen of voor de inwoners van alle landen beschikbaar en Adobe kan op
elk gewenst moment en ongeacht de reden de beschikbaarheid van een Onlinedienst van derden
wijzigen of staken.
16.4.3 TENZIJ UITDRUKKELIJK DOOR ADOBE, DE AAN HAAR GELIEERDE VENNOOTSCHAPPEN OF EEN
DERDE IN EEN AFZONDERLIJKE OVEREENKOMST IS OVEREENGEKOMEN, GESCHIEDT HET GEBRUIK
VAN ONLINEDIENSTEN VAN ADOBE EN DERDEN VOOR EIGEN RISICO KRACHTENS DE GARANTIE- EN
AANSPRAKELIJKHEIDSBEPERKINGEN VAN ARTIKEL 7 EN 8.
16.5 Digitale certificaten.
16.5.1 Gebruik. Digitale certificaten worden door derde certificerende instanties gebruikt, zoals Adobe
CDS-leveranciers (Certified Document Services) die zijn vermeld op
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_nl, en AATL-leveranciers (Adobe Approved Trust List) die zijn
vermeld op http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_nl (tezamen te noemen “Certificerende Instanties”), of
kunnen zelfondertekend zijn.
16.5.2 Bepalingen en voorwaarden. Als de Klant digitale certificaten aanschaft, gebruikt en erop
vertrouwt, ligt de verantwoordelijkheid hiervoor bij de Klant en een Certificerende instantie. Voordat de
Klant een gecertificeerd document, een digitale handtekening of de diensten van een Certificerende
instantie vertrouwt, dient de Klant na te gaan onder welke voorwaarden en bepalingen de betreffende
Certificerende instantie diensten aanbiedt, zoals overeenkomsten van abonnees, overeenkomsten van
belanghebbende partijen, praktijk ten aanzien van certificaten en verklaringen omtrent beleid. Klik op
de koppelingen op http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_nl voor meer informatie over CDS-
leveranciers van Adobe en op http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_nl voor meer informatie over AATL-
leveranciers.
16.5.3 Bevestiging. De Klant gaat ermee akkoord dat (a) de Software, door configuratie- of externe
problemen, een handtekening kan bevatten die als geldig wordt weergegeven ondanks het feit dat een
digitaal certificaat is ingetrokken of vervallen voorafgaand aan de verificatie, (b) de veiligheid of
integriteit van een digitaal certificaat in opspraak kan raken doordat de ondertekenaar van het
document, de betreffende Certificerende instantie of een derde partij iets heeft gedaan of nagelaten en
(c) een certificaat een zelfondertekend certificaat kan zijn dat niet door een Certificerende instantie is
verstrekt. DE KLANT IS ZELF VOLLEDIG VERANTWOORDELIJK OM AL DAN NIET TE VERTROUWEN OP
EEN CERTIFICAAT. TENZIJ EEN AFZONDERLIJKE, SCHRIFTELIJKE GARANTIE AAN DE KLANT IS
VERSTREKT DOOR EEN CERTIFICERENDE INSTANTIE, GEBRUIKT DE KLANT DIGITALE CERTIFICATEN
OP EIGEN RISICO.
16.5.4 Belanghebbende derde partijen. De klant gaat ermee akkoord dat elke Certificerende instantie
waarop de Klant vertrouwt, een belanghebbende derde partij van deze Overeenkomst is en het recht
heeft om deze Overeenkomst op eigen initiatief af te dwingen alsof de Certificerende instantie Adobe is.
--- Page 92 ---
16.5.5 Schadevergoeding. De Klant stemt ermee in om Adobe en elke toepasselijke Certificerende
instantie (behalve zoals nadrukkelijk beschreven in de bepalingen en voorwaarden) te vrijwaren van
aansprakelijkheid, schade of vorderingen (inclusief redelijke onkosten en advocaatkosten) die
voortkomen uit of betrekking hebben op het gebruik van, of het vertrouwen op, een dienst van een
Certificerende instanatie door de klant, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot: (a) het vertrouwen op een
verlopen of ingetrokken certificaat; (b) de onjuiste controle van een certificaat, (c) het gebruik van een
certificaat op een andere manier dan is toegestaan door van toepassing zijnde bepalingen en
voorwaarden, deze Overeenkomst of toepasselijke wetgeving; (d) het, in gegeven omstandigheden, niet
aanwenden van een redelijk inzicht of beoordelingsvermogen bij het vertrouwen op de diensten van de
uitgever of certificaten of (e) het niet nakomen van de verplichtingen zoals vastgelegd in de bepalingen
en voorwaarden met betrekking tot de diensten.
16.6 Fontsoftware. Indien deze Software fontsoftware bevat, geldt het volgende:
16.6.1 De Klant mag de fontsoftware met de Software gebruiken op Computers, zoals bedoeld in
artikel 2, en de fontsoftware uitvoeren naar elk uitvoerapparaat dat met een dergelijke Computer is
verbonden.
16.6.2 Indien het Toegestane aantal Computers vijf (5) of minder bedraagt, mag de Klant de
fontsoftware downloaden naar het geheugen (harde schijf of RAM) van een uitvoerapparaat dat is
verbonden met ten minste één dergelijke Computer, met het doel de fontsoftware resident in een
dergelijk uitvoerapparaat te hebben, en met één bijkomend uitvoerapparaat voor elk veelvoud van vijf
dat wordt vertegenwoordigd door het Toegestane aantal Computers.
16.6.3 De Klant mag een kopie van de door de Klant voor een bepaald bestand gebruikte font(s) naar
een commerciële printer of ander servicebureau verzenden; een dergelijk servicebureau kan de
font(s) gebruiken om het bestand van de Klant te verwerken, mits een dergelijk servicebureau beschikt
over een geldige licentie voor het gebruik van de desbetreffende fontsoftware.
16.6.4 De klant mag kopieën van de fontsoftware insluiten in elektronische documenten zodat de Klant
het document kan afdrukken, weergeven en bewerken. Onder deze licentie worden geen andere
rechten op insluiting geïmpliceerd of toegestaan.
16.6.5 Als uitzondering op wat hierboven is beschreven, worden de opgesomde fonts op
http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_nl alleen opgenomen in de software ten behoeve van de
werking van de gebruikersinterface van software en niet voor toevoeging in outputbestanden.
Dergelijke vermelde fonts worden niet in licentie verstrekt onder dit artikel 16.6. De Klant gaat ermee
akkoord dergelijke vermelde fonts niet te zullen kopiëren, verplaatsen, activeren of gebruiken en niet te
zullen toestaan dat in een beheerprogramma voor fonts dergelijke vermelde fonts worden gekopieerd,
verplaatst, geactiveerd of gebruikt in of met softwaretoepassingen, programma's of andere bestanden
dan de Software.
16.7 Render Engine voor After Effects. Als de Software de volledige versie van Adobe After Effects bevat,
mag de Klant een onbeperkt aantal kopieën van de Render Engine installeren op Computers die deel
uitmaken van het Interne netwerk van de Klant, waarin ten minste één Computer de volledige versie
van de software van Adobe After Effects bevat. De aanduiding “Render Engine” staat voor een
installeerbaar deel van de Software waarmee projecten van After Effects kunnen worden gegenereerd,
maar dat niet kan worden gebruikt voor het maken of wijzigen van projecten en niet de volledige
gebruikersinterface van After Effects bevat.
16.8 Functies van Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro en Adobe Acrobat Suite. Als de Software Acrobat
Standard, Acrobat Pro, Acrobat Suite of bepaalde functies binnen de bovenstaande software bevat, is dit
artikel 16.8 van toepassing.
--- Page 93 ---
16.8.1 Aanvullende definities.
16.8.1.1 “Implementeren” betekent het direct of indirect overdragen of anderszins beschikbaar stellen
van een Uitgebreid document aan een of meer ontvangers, op enigerlei wijze, met inbegrip van maar
niet beperkt tot een netwerk of internet.
16.8.1.2 “Uitgebreid document” betekent een PDF-bestand dat met gebruikmaking van de Software is
gemanipuleerd om het mogelijk te maken documenten met ingevulden PDF-formulieren lokaal op te
slaan.
16.8.2 De Software kan activeringstechnologie bevatten waarmee de Klant PDF-documenten met
bepaalde functies kan activeren via het gebruik van digitale referentie die in de Software is geplaatst
(“Sleutel”). De klant gaat ermee akkoord voor geen enkel doel toegang te zullen krijgen of proberen te
krijgen tot de Sleutel, of de Sleutel te beheersen, te deactiveren, te verwijderen, te gebruiken of te
verspreiden.
16.8.3 Voor elk Uitgebreid document mag de Klant alleen (a) dit Uitgebreid document Implementeren
voor een onbeperkt aantal unieke ontvangers, maar geen gegevens extraheren of laten extraheren uit
meer dan vijfhonderd (500) unieke exemplaren van dit Uitgebreid document of een gedrukte weergave
van dit Uitgebreid document met ingevulde formuliervelden; of (b) dit Uitgebreid document
Implementeren voor niet meer dan vijfhonderd (500) unieke ontvangers zonder beperkingen ten
aanzien van het aantal keren dat de Klant gegevens kan extraheren uit dit Uitgebreid document dat
ingevuld door deze ontvangers naar de Klant is geretourneerd. Niettegenstaande enige andersluidende
bepaling in deze Overeenkomst worden de voornoemde beperkingen niet uitgebreid wanneer de Klant
aanvullende licenties voor het gebruik van Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro of Adobe Acrobat Suite
aanschaft (voornoemde beperkingen zijn derhalve de totale limieten, ongeacht het aantal aanvullende
licenties dat de Klant mogelijk heeft aangeschaft voor het gebruik van Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro of
Adobe Acrobat Suite).
16.9 Flash Player-projectors en runtime. De rechten van de Klant op het gebruik van een Flash Player,
projector, afzonderlijke player, plug-in, runtime of ActiveX-besturingselement, welke tezamen met of als
onderdeel van de Software of in een Outputbestand wordt geleverd, luiden uitsluitend zoals vermeld op
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_usage_nl. Tenzij en voor zover daaruit het tegendeel blijkt, is de
Klant niet gerechtigd dergelijke software te gebruiken of te verspreiden.
16.10 Contribute Publishing Services. Behoudens de bepalingen van de bij de Contribute Publishing
Services-software behorende licentieovereenkomst voor eindgebruikers mag de Klant geen verbinding
met de Contribute Publishing Services-software maken, tenzij de Klant een licentie heeft aangeschaft
voor het maken van verbindingen met voornoemde Contribute Publishing Services-software voor elke
persoon die verbinding met voornoemde Contribute Publishing Services-software mag maken; echter
met dien verstande dat proefversies van Adobe Contribute-software mogen worden geïnstalleerd en
verbinding mogen maken met de Contribute Publishing Services-software in overeenstemming met de
bij de Contribute Publishing Services-software behorende licentieovereenkomst voor eindgebruikers.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Als de Software Adobe Presenter bevat en de Klant in dat geval de
invoegtoepassing Adobe Connect installeert of gebruikt in combinatie met het gebruik van de Software,
gaat de Klant ermee akkoord om een dergelijke invoegtoepassing uitsluitend op een desktopcomputer
te installeren en gebruiken en niet op enig ander product dan een pc, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot een
webtoepassing, settopbox, draagbaar apparaat, telefoon of webpadapparaat. Bovendien mag het
gedeelte van de Software dat is ingesloten in een presentatie, informatie of inhoud die met
gebruikmaking van de Software is gemaakt en gegenereerd (de “Adobe Presenter Run-Time”),
uitsluitend tezamen met de presentatie, informatie of inhoud worden gebruikt waarin het betreffende
item is ingesloten. Het is de Klant niet toegestaan de Adobe Presenter Run-Time ingesloten in
presentaties, informatie of inhoud te gebruiken en de Klant dient voormeld verbod op te leggen aan
alle licentienemers van voornoemde presentaties, informatie of inhoud. Bovendien is het de Klant niet
toegestaan de Adobe Presenter Run-Time te wijzigen, disassembleren of aan reverse-engineering te
--- Page 94 ---
onderwerpen en de Klant dient voornoemd verbod op te leggen aan alle licentiehouders van
voornoemde presentaties, informatie en inhoud.
16.12 Flash Builder met LCDS-bibliotheek (LiveCycle Data Services) voor gegevensbeheer. Adobe Flash
Builder kan de fds.swc-bibliotheek bevatten. De Klant mag fds.swc uitsluitend gebruiken om
mogelijkheden voor beheer van cliëntgegevens beschikbaar te stellen en als outputbestand in software
die de Klant heeft ontwikkeld, behoudens het volgende. De Klant heeft geen toestemming om
(a) fds.swc te gebruiken om koppelingen of offline-mogelijkheden in software in te schakelen of
(b) fds.swc op te nemen in software die vergelijkbaar is met Adobe LiveCycle Data Services of BlazeDS.
Als de Klant een van de voornoemde dingen wenst te doen, dient de Klant een aparte licentie aan te
vragen bij Adobe.
16.13 Digital Publishing Suite. De volgende voorwaarden zijn van toepassing als de Software bepaalde
onderdelen of functies bevat die zijn ontworpen om te werken met of toegang te verkrijgen tot Digital
Publishing Suite conform de Aanvullende gebruiksvoorwaarden voor Digital Publishing Suite. “DPS-
desktoptools” betekent Folio Overlays Panel, Folio Builder Panel, Content Viewer for Desktop, en Digital
Publishing Plug-in for InDesign. Als de Software een DPS-desktoptool (of een onderdeel hiervan) bevat,

CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PROVISIONS ON
LICENSE RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 4, LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTIONS 6 AND 7, LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY IN SECTION 8, AND SPECIFIC PROVISIONS AND EXCEPTIONS IN SECTION 16. CUSTOMER
AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKE ANY WRITTEN NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT SIGNED BY
CUSTOMER. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST CUSTOMER. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT
AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
Customer may have another written agreement directly with Adobe (e.g., a volume license agreement)
that supplements or supersedes all or portions of this agreement. The Software is LICENSED, NOT SOLD,
only in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Use of some Adobe and some non-Adobe
materials and services included in or accessed through the Software may be subject to additional terms
and conditions. Notices about non-Adobe materials are available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/thirdparty.
The Software may cause Customer’s Computer to AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO THE INTERNET. The
Software may also require activation or registration. Additional information on activation, Internet
connectivity, and privacy is available in Sections 14 and 16.
1. Definitions.
1.1 “Adobe” means Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, 345 Park Avenue, San Jose,
California 95110, if this agreement is entered into while Customer is in the United States, Canada, or
Mexico; otherwise, it means Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4–6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business
Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland.
1.2 “Adobe Runtime(s)” means Adobe AIR, Adobe Flash Player, Shockwave Player, or Authorware
Player.
1.3 “Compatible Computer” means a Computer with the recommended operating system and hardware
configuration as stated in the Documentation.

other software applications.
1.5 “Customer” means you and any legal entity that obtained the Software and on whose behalf it is
used; for example, and as applicable, your employer.
1.6 “Internal Network” means a private, proprietary network resource accessible only by employees and
individual contractors (i.e., temporary employees) of a specific corporation or similar business entity.

modified versions and copies of, and upgrades, updates, and additions to, such information, provided to
Customer by Adobe at any time, to the extent not provided under separate terms (collectively,
“Updates”).
2. Software License; Membership.
2.1 Software License. This Section 2.1 applies to Customers who have purchased a license to the
Software but have not purchased a membership-based license or service such as the Creative Cloud
membership (as described in Section 2.2).
2.1.1 License Grant. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance with this Agreement and payment of
the applicable license fees, Adobe grants Customer a non-exclusive and limited license to install and use
the Software (a) in the territory or region where Customer obtains the Software from Adobe or Adobe’s
authorized reseller or as otherwise stated in the Documentation (“Territory”), (b) during the term of such
license (“License Term”), (c) within the scope of the License Type and on the Permitted Number of
Customer’s Compatible Computers as specified in the Documentation, and (d) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and applicable Documentation. Unless otherwise defined in this
Agreement, in the applicable Documentation, or at the time of purchase, License Term shall be
perpetual. Upon the expiration or termination of the License Term, some or all of the Software may
cease to operate without prior notice. Upon expiration or termination of the License Term, Customer
may not use the Software unless Customer has renewed the license. The license granted herein is
supplemented by specific provisions in Section 16 as related to the use of certain applicable products
and components that may be included in the Software such as font software, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite, and Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 License Types.
2.1.2.1 Non-Serialized Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided without a
serial number during the License Term may only be installed and used on any number of Compatible
Computers as part of an organizational deployment plan during the License Term for demonstration,
evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any Output Files or other materials produced through
such use are used only for internal, non-commercial, and non-production purposes. THE NON-
SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS-IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED
WITH SUCH NON-SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.
2.1.2.2 Evaluation Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided with a serial
number designated for “evaluation purposes” or other similar designation (such as Software or a serial
number supplied as “EVAL” under a separate agreement) (“Evaluation Software”) may only be installed
and used on Permitted Number of Compatible Computers during the License Term for demonstration,
evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any Output Files or other materials produced through
such use are used only for internal, non-commercial, and non-production purposes. THE EVALUATION
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED WITH SUCH
EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.
2.1.2.3 Subscription Edition. For the Software available on a subscription-basis (“Subscription Edition”),
Customer may install and use the Subscription Edition only on the Permitted Number of Compatible
Computer during the License Term. Subject to the Permitted Number of Computers for the Subscription
Edition, Adobe may allow Customer to install and use the most recent prior version of the Subscription
Edition and the current version of the Subscription Edition on the same Computer during the License
--- Page 98 ---
Term. Customer agrees that Adobe may change the type of Software (such as specific components,
versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in the Subscription Edition at any time and shall not be
liable to Customer whatsoever for such change. Ongoing access to a Subscription Edition requires: (a) a
recurring Internet connection to activate, renew, and validate the license, (b) Adobe or its authorized
reseller’s receipt of recurring subscription payments, and (c) Customer’s agreement to subscription
terms and other additional terms and conditions that are available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms or at the time of purchase. If Adobe does not receive the
recurring subscription payment or cannot validate the license periodically, then the Software may
become inactive without additional notice until Adobe receives the payment or validates the license.
2.1.3 Portable or Home Computer Use. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.1.4, the
primary user of the Computer on which the Software is installed under Section 2.1 (“Primary User”)
may install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on either a portable Computer
or a Computer located at his or her home, provided that the Software on the portable or home
Computer is not used at the same time as the Software on the primary Computer.
2.1.4 Restrictions on Secondary Use by Volume Licensees. If the Software was obtained under an Adobe
volume license program or agreement (such as Adobe Volume Licensing) by any licensee other than an
educational volume licensee, then the second copy of the Software made under Section 2.1.3 must be
used solely for the benefit and business of that volume licensee.
2.1.5 Dual Boot Platform. The Software is licensed for use on a specific operating system platform.
Customer must purchase a separate license for use of the Software on each operating system platform.
By way of example, if Customer desires to install the Software on both the Mac OS and Windows
operating system platforms on a device that runs both of those platforms (i.e., a dual boot machine),
then Customer must first obtain two separate licenses for the Software. This is true even if two versions
of the Software, each designed for a different operating system platform, are delivered to Customer on
the same media.
2.1.6 Distribution from a Server. As permitted by the Documentation, Customer may copy an image of
the Software onto a Computer file server within Customer’s Internal Network (“Server”) for the purpose
of downloading and installing the Software onto Computers within the same Internal Network for use
only as permitted by this Section 2.
2.1.7 Server Use.
2.1.7.1 As permitted in a separate purchasing document or Documentation and subject to license
restrictions stated in this Agreement, Customer may install the Software on a Server only for the
purpose of allowing an individual from a Computer within the same Internal Network (“Network User”)
to access and use the Software. The Network User who has access to such Software on the Server is
referred to as “Server Software User”. The total number of Server Software Users (not the concurrent
number of users) may not exceed the Permitted Number. By way of example, if Customer has
purchased 10 licenses of Software (Permitted Number is 10) and Customer elects to install the Software
on a Server, then Customer can only allow up to 10 Server Software Users the access to the Software
(even though Customer may have more than 10 Network Users or fewer than 10 concurrent users of
the Software).
2.1.7.2 For clarification and without limitation, the foregoing does not permit Customer to install or
access (either directly or through commands, data, or instructions) the Software: (a) from or to a
Computer not part of Customer’s Internal Network; (b) for enabling web hosted workgroups or web
hosted services available to the public; (c) by any individual or entity to use, download, copy, or
otherwise benefit from the functionality of the Software unless licensed to do so by Adobe; (d) as a
component of a system, workflow or service accessible by more than the Permitted Number of users; or
(e) for operations not initiated by an individual user (e.g., automated server processing).
2.2 Membership. This Section 2.2 applies to Customers who have purchased a membership-based
license or service such as the Creative Cloud membership (collectively, “Membership”).
--- Page 99 ---
2.2.1 Adobe Online Services Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance
with this Agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer a
non-exclusive, Territory-wide and limited right to access and use the Software and related Adobe
Online Service (as further described in Section 16.4.1) as part of the Membership, subject to the terms
stated in this Agreement and the Additional Terms of Use (as the term is defined in Section 14.1.3
below).
2.2.2 Software License Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance with
this Agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer a non-
exclusive and limited license to install and use the Software: (a) in the Territory, (b) during the period
that the Membership is current and active (“Membership Term”) and (c) in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and applicable Documentation. Upon the expiration or termination of the
Membership Term, (x) some or all of the Software may cease to operate without prior notice and
(y) Customer may not use the Software unless Customer has renewed the membership. All terms
related to the specific Software as stated in this Agreement shall remain effective and continue to apply
to Customer and its use of such Software.
2.2.3 Restrictions. Customer agrees to the following additional terms and restrictions related to the
Membership: (a) Adobe may change the type of Software (such as specific products, components,
versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in the Membership at any time and shall not be liable to
Customer whatsoever for such change; (b) Customer may be required to connect to the Internet and log
in at any time during the Membership Term; (c) Software may automatically connect to the Internet to
verify Customer’s Membership without notice at any time; and (d) Customer may not enable or allow
others to use the Software as Customer.
2.3 Content Files. Unless stated otherwise in the “Read-Me” files, Documentation, or other license(s)
associated with the Content Files, Customer may use, display, modify, reproduce, and distribute any of
the Content Files. However, Customer may not distribute the Content Files on a stand-alone basis (i.e.,
in circumstances in which the Content Files constitute the primary value of the product being
distributed), and Customer may not claim any trademark rights in the Content Files or derivative works
thereof. Nothing stated herein shall affect the ownership of the Software as stated in Section 3.
2.4 Sample Application Code. Customer may modify the source code form of those portions of the
Software programs that are expressly identified as sample code, sample application code, code snippets,
ActionScript class files, or sample components (each, “Sample Application Code”) in the accompanying
Documentation solely for the purposes of designing, developing, and testing websites and applications
developed using Adobe software programs; provided, however, Customer is permitted to copy and
distribute the Sample Application Code (modified or unmodified) only if all of the following conditions
are met: (a) Customer distributes only the compiled object code versions of the Sample Application
Code with its application; (b) Customer does not include the Sample Application Code in any product or
application designed for website development; and (c) Customer does not use the Adobe name, logos,
icons, or other Adobe trademarks to market its application. Customer agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s
fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of its application.
2.5 Programming Languages. The Software may include portions of the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK. Subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 2, Adobe grants to Customer a
nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the items in the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK only for the purpose of internal development of application programs designed to function
with Adobe products. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.5, no portions of the ExtendScript
SDK or the Pixel Bender SDK may be modified or distributed. Customer agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s
fees, that arise or result from such distribution.
--- Page 100 ---
2.6 Documentation Copies. Customer may make copies of the Documentation for its own internal use in
connection with use of the Software in accordance with this agreement, but no more than the amount
reasonably necessary.
3. Intellectual Property Ownership.
The Software and any authorized copies that Customer makes are the intellectual property of and are
owned by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The structure, organization, and source code
of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Adobe Systems
Incorporated and its suppliers. The Software is protected by law, including but not limited to the
copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as
expressly stated herein, this agreement does not grant Customer any intellectual property rights in the
Software. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Adobe and its suppliers.
4. Restrictions and Requirements.
4.1 Proprietary Notices. Any permitted copy of the Software (including without limitation
Documentation) that Customer makes must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices
that appear on or in the Software.
4.2 Use Obligations. Customer agrees that it will not use the Software other than as permitted by this
agreement and that it will not use the Software in a manner inconsistent with its design or
Documentation.
4.3 No Modifications. Except as expressly permitted in Sections 2 or 16, Customer may not modify, port,
adapt, or translate the Software.
4.4 No Reverse Engineering. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 16.1, Customer will not
reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the
Software.
4.5 No Unbundling. The Software may include various applications and components, may allow access
to different Adobe Online Services, may support multiple platforms and languages, and may be
provided to Customer on multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the Software is designed
and provided to Customer as a single product to be used as a single product on Computers as permitted
herein. Unless otherwise permitted in the Documentation, Customer is not required to install all
component parts of the Software, but Customer may not unbundle the component parts of the Software
for use on different Computers.
4.6 No Transfer.
4.6.1 CUSTOMER WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN, OR TRANSFER ITS RIGHTS IN
THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, SOFTWARE OBTAINED THROUGH A WEB
DOWNLOAD), OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN.
4.6.2 Except with regard to Educational Software Products (as defined in Section 16.3), Pre-release
Software (as defined in Section 16.2), Evaluation Software, not-for-resale copies of the Software, or
Software obtained through an Adobe volume license program and further subject to Section 4.6.3,
Customer may permanently transfer all its rights to use the Software to another individual or legal entity
provided that: (a) Customer also transfers (i) this agreement, (ii) the serial number(s), the Software
affixed to media provided by Adobe or its authorized distributor, and all other software or hardware
bundled, packaged, or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and Prior Versions
(as defined in Section 5, below), and (iii) all copies of font software to such individual or entity;
(b) Customer retains no Updates, Prior Versions, or copies, including backups and copies stored on a
Computer; and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this agreement and any other
--- Page 101 ---
terms and conditions under which Customer purchased a valid license to the Software. Additional
information on transferring volume licensed software is available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies.
4.6.3 If the Software requires recurring activation or registration and Adobe grants Customer’s request to
be exempted from the requirement of such recurring activation or registration, then in addition to the
restrictions set forth in the Activation Terms (as defined in Section 14.3), then the right to permanently
transfer as stated in Section 4.6.2 shall terminate immediately upon the grant of such request.
4.7 No Service Bureau. Customer will not use or offer the Software on a service bureau basis.
Section 16.6.3 provides a limited exception for font software only.
4.8 Adobe Runtime Restrictions. Customer will not use Adobe Runtimes on any non-PC device or with
any embedded or device version of any operating system. For the avoidance of doubt, and by example
only, Customer may not use Adobe Runtimes on any (a) mobile device, set top box, handheld, phone,
game console, TV, DVD player, media center (other than with Windows XP Media Center Edition and its
successors), electronic billboard or other digital signage, Internet appliance or other Internet-connected
device, PDA, medical device, ATM, telematic device, gaming machine, home automation system, kiosk,
remote control device, or any other consumer electronics device; (b) operator-based mobile, cable,
satellite, or television system; or (c) other closed system device. Additional information on licensing
Adobe Runtimes is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing.
4.9 Territory. Customer shall only use the Software and access the Adobe Online Services in the
Territory and in a manner consistent with the activation policy described at
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation. Adobe may terminate the license granted herein or suspend the
Membership or access to the Adobe Online Services if Adobe determines that Customer is using the
Software or Adobe Online Services outside the Territory.
5. Updates.
If the Software is an Update to a prior version of Adobe software (the “Prior Version”), then Customer’s
use of this Update is conditional upon its retention of the Prior Version. Therefore, if Customer validly
transfers this Update pursuant to Section 4.6, the Customer must transfer the Prior Version along with it.
If Customer wishes to use this Update in addition to the Prior Version, then Customer may only do so on
the same Computer on which it has installed and is using the Prior Version. Any obligations that Adobe
may have to support Prior Versions during the License Term may end upon the availability of this
Update. No other use of the Update is permitted. Additional Updates may be licensed to Customer by
Adobe with additional or different terms.
6. Limited Warranty.
Except as otherwise stated in a separate agreement between Adobe and a Software licensee, Adobe
warrants to the individual or entity that first purchases a license for the Software for use pursuant to the
terms of this agreement that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the
corresponding user manual for the Software for the shorter period of (a) the ninety (90) day period or
(b) License Term following receipt of the Software (“Warranty Period”) when used on the Compatible
Computer. Non-substantial variation of performance from the user manual does not establish a
warranty right. This limited warranty does not apply to the following, which are made available AS-IS
and without warranty from Adobe: (i) patches; (ii) font software; (iii) Pre-release Software, trial, starter,
evaluation, product sampler, Evaluation Software, and not-for-resale copies of the Software;
(iv) websites, Adobe Online Services; and Third Party Online Services; (v) Certified Document Services
(see Section 16); and (vi) any software made available by Adobe for free via web download from an
Adobe website. All warranty claims must be made, along with proof of purchase, to the Adobe
Customer Support Department within such Warranty Period. Additional information on warranty claims
is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/support. The entire liability of Adobe and its affiliates related
--- Page 102 ---
to such warranty claim and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy under any warranty will be limited to
either, at Adobe’s option, support of the Software based on the warranty claim, replacement of the
Software, or, if support or replacement is not practicable at Adobe’s determination, refund of the license
fee Customer paid for the Software (if any). THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION
GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER
LAW WHICH MAY VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT
CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. Please see Section 16
for jurisdiction-specific provisions or contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.
7. Disclaimer.
THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 6 AND ANY STATUTORY WARRANTY AND REMEDY THAT
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER LAW ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE. OTHER THAN THOSE OFFERED AND STATUTORY
WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES
(DEFINED BELOW) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND TERMS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE, OR OTHERWISE AS
TO ANY MATTER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY
QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. OTHER THAN SUCH OFFERED AND
STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, THE SOFTWARE AND ACCESS TO ANY WEBSITES, ADOBE
OR THIRD PARTY ONLINE SERVICES, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS
AND WITH ALL FAULTS. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME
JURISDICTIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH MAY
NOT BE WAIVED OR DISCLAIMED. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY
RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. The provisions of Sections 7 and Section 8 will
survive the termination of this agreement, howsoever caused, but this will not imply or create any
continued right to use the Software after termination of this agreement.
8. Limitation of Liability.
EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OFFERED BY ADOBE ABOVE AND ANY REMEDIES THAT
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER LAW, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS,
OR COSTS WHATSOEVER INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
PERSONAL INJURY OR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY OF CARE, OR CLAIMS BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN
IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES,
CLAIMS, OR COSTS. IN ANY EVENT, ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS AFFILIATES,
SUPPLIERS, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY
EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL BREACH OR A BREACH OF THE
FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. Nothing contained in this agreement
limits Adobe’s liability to Customer in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe’s
negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its affiliates, suppliers, and
Certificate Authorities for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and limiting obligations, warranties, and
liability, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW IN CUSTOMER’S JURISDICTION. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME
JURISDICTIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED UNDER CONSUMER
PROTECTION AND OTHER LAWS. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT ITS WARRANTY OR REMEDIES TO
ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. SEE SECTION 16 FOR JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC STATEMENTS.

9. Export Rules.
Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the
“EAR”) and that Customer will comply with the EAR. Customer will not export or re-export the Software,
directly or indirectly, to: (a) any countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions (including, but not
limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), (b) any end user whom Customer knows or has
reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets, or unmanned air
vehicle systems, or (c) any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S. export
transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. In addition, Customer is responsible for
complying with any local laws in Customer’s jurisdiction which may impact its right to import, export or
use the Software. If Adobe has knowledge that a violation has occurred, Adobe may be prohibited from
providing maintenance and support for the Software.
10. Governing Law.
If Customer is a consumer who uses the Software for only personal non-business purposes, then this
agreement will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction which Customer purchased the license to use
the Software. If Customer is not such a consumer, this agreement will be governed by and construed in

12. Notice to U.S. Government End Users.
12.1 U.S. Government Licensing of Adobe Technology. Customer agrees that when licensing Adobe
Software for acquisition by the U.S. Government, or any contractor therefore, Customer will license
consistent with the policies set forth in 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 (for civilian agencies) and 48 C.F.R.
Sections 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-4 (for the Department of Defense). For U.S. Government End Users,
Adobe agrees to comply with all applicable equal opportunity laws including, if appropriate, the
provisions of Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans
Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 USC 4212), and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,

12.2 Commercial Items. For U.S. Government End Users, Software is a “Commercial Item(s),” as that
term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Section 2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and
“Commercial Computer Software Documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212
or 48 C.F.R. Section 227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
Sections 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and
Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users
(a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users
pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of
the United States.
13. Compliance with Licenses.
If Customer is a business, company, or organization, Customer agrees that, in addition to any license
compliance checking performed by the Software, Adobe or its authorized representative have the right,
no more than once every twelve (12) months, upon seven (7) business days’ prior notice to Customer,
to inspect Customer’s records, systems, and facilities to verify that its use of any and all Adobe software
or service is in conformity with its valid licenses from Adobe. For example, Adobe has the right to those
of Customer’s records useful to determine whether installations of the Software have been serialized,
and Customer shall provide such records to Adobe promptly upon request by Adobe. Additionally,
Customer shall provide Adobe with all records and information requested by Adobe in order to verify
that its use of any and all Adobe software is in conformity with its valid licenses from Adobe within
thirty (30) days of Adobe’s request. Additional information on serialization is available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing.
14. Internet Connectivity and Privacy.
14.1 Automatic Connections to the Internet. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without
notice, to automatically connect to the Internet and to communicate with an Adobe website or Adobe
domain for purposes such as license validation and providing Customer with additional information,
features, or functionality. Unless otherwise specified in Sections 14.2 through 14.7, the following
provisions apply to all automatic Internet connections by the Software:
14.1.1 Whenever the Software makes an Internet connection and communicates with an Adobe
website, whether automatically or due to explicit user request, the Privacy Policy shall apply. Adobe
Privacy Policy allows tracking of website visits and it addresses in detail the topic of tracking and use of
cookies, web beacons, and similar devices.
14.1.2 Whenever the Software connects to Adobe over the Internet, certain Customer information is
collected and transmitted by the Software to Adobe pursuant to the Adobe Online Privacy Policy
available at http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy (“Privacy Policy”).
--- Page 105 ---
14.1.3 If Customer accesses an Adobe Online Service (as defined in Section 16.4 below) or activates or
registers the Software, then additional information such as Customer’s Adobe ID, user name, and
password may be transmitted to and stored by Adobe pursuant to the Privacy Policy and additional
terms of use related to such Adobe Online Service (collectively with the Adobe.com terms of use and
any applicable terms, the “Additional Terms of Use”).
14.1.4 As permitted by applicable law or as consented to by Customer, Adobe may (a) send Customer
transactional messages to facilitate the Adobe Online Service or the activation or registration of the
Software or Adobe Online Service, or (b) deliver in-product marketing to provide information about the
Software and other Adobe products and Services using information including but not limited to platform
version, version of the Software, license status, and language.
14.2 Updating. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice, to
automatically connect to the Internet (intermittently or on a regular basis) to (a) check for Updates that
are available for download to and installation on the Computer and (b) notify Adobe of the results of
installation attempts.
14.3 Activation. The Software may require Customer to (a) obtain an Adobe ID, (b) activate or reactivate
the Software, (c) register the software, or (d) validate the Membership. Such requirement may cause
Customer’s Computer to connect to the Internet without notice on install, on launch, and on a regular
basis thereafter. Once connected, the Software will collect and transmit information to Adobe as further
described at http://www.adobe.com/go/activation (“Activation Terms”). Software or Customer may also
receive information from Adobe related to Customer’s license, subscription, or Membership. Adobe
may use such information to detect or prevent fraudulent or unauthorized use not in accordance with a
valid license, subscription, or Membership. Failure to activate or register the Software, validate the
subscription or Membership, or a determination by Adobe of fraudulent or unauthorized use of the
Software may result in reduced functionality, inoperability of the Software, or a termination or
suspension of the subscription or Membership.
14.4 Deactivation. Customer may deactivate and uninstall the Software from its Computer in order to
install and activate the Software on another Computer in accordance with this agreement
(“Deactivation”) and as further described in http://www.adobe.com/go/activation. Deactivation requires
Internet connectivity.
14.5 Use of Online Services. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice
and on an intermittent or regular basis, to automatically connect to the Internet to facilitate Customer’s
access to content and services that are provided by Adobe or third parties as further described in
Section 16.4 (Online Services). In addition, the Software may, without additional notice, automatically
connect to the Internet to update downloadable materials from these online services so as to provide
immediate availability of these services even when Customer is offline.
14.6 Digital Certificates. The Software uses digital certificates (as described in Section 16.5) to help
Customer identify downloaded files (e.g., applications and content) and the publishers of those files. For
example, Adobe AIR uses digital certificates to help Customer identify the publisher of Adobe AIR
applications. The Adobe Acrobat family of products also uses digital certificates to sign and validate
signatures within Portable Document Format (“PDF”) documents and to validate certified PDF
documents. Customer’s Computer may connect to the Internet at the time of validation of a digital
certificate.
14.7 Settings Manager. The Software may include Flash Player. Flash Player may save certain user
settings by storing them on Customer’s Computer as a local shared object. They are associated with the
instance of Flash Player on the Computer, allowing Customer to customize runtime features. The Flash
Player Settings Manager permits Customer to modify such settings, including the ability to limit third
parties from storing local shared objects or grant third party content the right to access the computer’s
microphone and camera. Additional information on how to configure settings in its version of Flash
Player, including information on how to disable local shared objects using the Flash Player Settings
--- Page 106 ---
Manager, is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager. Additional information on local
shared objects is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security.
15. Peer-to-Peer Communications.
The Software may use Customer’s connection to a local area network, without additional notice, to
automatically connect to other Adobe software and, in doing so, may indicate on the local area network
that it is available for communication with other Adobe software. These connections may transmit the
IP Address of Customer’s connection to the local network.
16. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.
This section sets forth specific provisions related to certain products and components of the Software as
well as limited exceptions to the above terms and conditions. To the extent that any provision in this
section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, the terms stated in this section
will supersede such other term or condition.
16.1 No Prejudice; European Economic Area Provisions; Australia Mandatory Notice.
16.1.1 This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those dealing as
consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software for personal,
domestic, or household use (not business purposes), this agreement is subject to the Consumer
Guarantees Act.
16.1.2 If Customer obtained the Software in the European Economic Area (EEA), Customer usually
resides in the EEA and Customer is a consumer (that is its use of the Software is for personal, non-
business related purposes), then Section 6 (Limited Warranty) does not apply to Customer’s purchase
and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for a period of 2 years from purchase that the Software
provides the functionalities set forth in the applicable user manual (the “agreed upon functionalities”)
when used on the Compatible Computer. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon
functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO
SOFTWARE THAT CUSTOMER USES ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, OR PRODUCT SAMPLER
BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE, OR TO THE EXTENT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT
HAS BEEN ALTERED BY CUSTOMER. To make a warranty claim, Customer must notify the Adobe
Customer Support Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of purchase of the
Software. Adobe will verify with Customer whether there is a defect in the Software or advise Customer
that the error arises because Customer has not installed the Software correctly (in which case, Adobe
shall assist Customer). If there is a defect in the Software, Customer may request from Adobe either a
refund or a repaired or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied by proof of
purchase. In the event Customer’s warranty details are substantiated, Adobe will meet Customer’s
request for repaired or replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for Adobe to do so, in which
case Adobe will provide Customer with a refund. For warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe
Customer Support Department.
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any
damages claims Customer makes in respect of its use of the Software. Nonetheless, Adobe shall be
liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach by Adobe of this
agreement. Customer is advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in
particular by making back-up copies of the Software and its computer data.
This agreement, and in particular this Section 16.1.2, is intended to describe Customer’s rights (including
its statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with its use of the Software. If Customer’s
statutory rights are greater than this description, its statutory rights shall apply.
16.1.3 Nothing included in this agreement (including Section 4.4) shall limit any non-waivable right to
decompile the Software that Customer may enjoy under applicable law. For example, if Customer is
--- Page 107 ---
located in the European Union (EU), Customer may have the right upon certain conditions specified in
the applicable law to decompile the Software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve
interoperability of the Software with another software program, and Customer has first asked Adobe in
writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such operability and Adobe has not made such
information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be performed by Customer or someone
else entitled to use a copy of the Software on Customer’s behalf. Adobe has the right to impose
reasonable conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Adobe or
obtained by Customer, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by Customer for the purpose
described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software that is
substantially similar to the expression of the Software or used for any other act that infringes the
copyright of Adobe or its licensors.
16.1.4 If Customer obtains the Software in Australia, then the following provision shall apply,
notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this Agreement:
NOTICE TO CONSUMERS IN AUSTRALIA:
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are
entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably
foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods
fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure. Our software products
also come with a 90-day limited warranty given by Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, with an
office at 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin, Ireland, as set out in the Agreement. If your
products do not provide the general features and functions described in the User Documentation in the
90-day period after delivery to you, please call the Adobe Customer Support Department at
1800 614 863 with details of your product, serial number, and proof of purchase. You may be required
to return the software product to the address we provide to you at the time, in which case such return
will be at your own cost. The benefits under this warranty are in addition to other rights and remedies
that you may have at law.
16.2 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software
(“Pre-release Software”), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software does not represent final
product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or
other failures and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. If
Customer received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the
Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release Software, then Customer’s use of the
Software is also governed by such agreement. Customer will promptly return or destroy all copies of
Pre-release Software upon the earlier of Adobe’s request or upon Adobe’s commercial release of such
Software. CUSTOMER’S USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT ITS OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 6 AND 8
FOR LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS RELATED TO PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
16.3 Educational Software Product. If the Software is Educational Software Product (Software
manufactured and distributed for use only by Educational End Users), Customer is not entitled to use
the Software unless Customer qualify in its jurisdiction as an Educational End User. Please visit
http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing to learn about eligibility. Please visit
http://www.adobe.com/go/store and look for the link for Buying Adobe Products Worldwide to find an
Adobe Authorized Academic Reseller.
16.4 Online Services.
16.4.1 Provided by Adobe. The Software facilitates Customer’s access to content and various services
that are hosted on websites maintained by Adobe or its affiliates (“Adobe Online Services”). Examples of
such Adobe Online Services might include, but are not limited to: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS
Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help, and product Welcome
Screens. In some cases an Adobe Online Service might appear as a feature or extension within the
Software even though it is hosted on a website. Access to an Adobe Online Service may require
Customer to activate the Software, obtain an Adobe ID, consent to Additional Terms of Use, or require a
--- Page 108 ---
separate fee in order to access such Adobe Online Services. Adobe Online Services might not be
available in all languages or to residents of all countries and Adobe may, at any time and for any reason,
modify or discontinue the availability of any Adobe Online Service. Adobe also reserves the right to
begin charging a fee for access to or use of an Adobe Online Service that was previously offered at no
charge. Section 14 states important information regarding Internet connectivity and Customer’s privacy.
As stated in Section 14, when the Software accesses an Adobe Online Service, Customer’s use of such
Adobe Online Service is governed by the Adobe Privacy Policy (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy), by
the Adobe.com Terms of Use (http://www.adobe.com/go/terms), and by any Additional Terms of Use
that might be presented to Customer at that time.
16.4.2 Provided by Third Parties. The Software may facilitate Customer’s access to websites maintained
by third parties offering goods, information, software, and services (“Third Party Online Services”).
Examples of such Third Party Online Services might include, but are not limited to, the Kodak EasyShare
Gallery service. Customer’s access to and use of any Third Party Online Services is governed by the
terms, conditions, disclaimers, and notices found on such site or otherwise associated with such Third
Party Online Services. Adobe does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility for Third Party Online
Services. Any dealings between Customer and any third party in connection with a Third Party Online
Service, including such party’s privacy policies and use of Customer’s personal information, delivery of
and payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations
associated with such dealings, are solely between Customer and such third party. Third Party Online
Services might not be available in all languages or to residents of all countries and Adobe may, at any
time and for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any Third Party Online Service.
16.4.3 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED BY ADOBE OR ITS AFFILIATES OR A THIRD PARTY IN A
SEPARATE AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER’S USE OF ADOBE ONLINE SERVICES AND THIRD PARTY ONLINE
SERVICES IS AT ITS OWN RISK UNDER THE WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 7
AND 8.
16.5 Digital Certificates.
16.5.1 Use. Digital certificates are issued by third party certificate authorities, including Adobe Certified
Document Services (CDS) vendors listed at http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds and Adobe
Approved Trust List vendors (“AATL”) listed at http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl (collectively “Certificate
Authorities”), or can be self-signed.
16.5.2 Terms and Conditions. Purchase, use, and reliance upon digital certificates is the responsibility of
Customer and a Certificate Authority. Before Customer relies upon any certified document, digital
signature, or Certificate Authority services, Customer should review the applicable terms and conditions
under which the relevant Certificate Authority provides services, including, for example, any subscriber
agreements, relying party agreements, certificate policies, and practice statements. See the links on

http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl for information about AATL vendors.
16.5.3 Acknowledgement. Customer agrees that (a) the Software, due to configuration or external
issues, might show a signature as valid despite the fact a digital certificate may have been revoked or
expired prior to the time of verification; (b) the security or integrity of a digital certificate may be
compromised due to an act or omission by the signer of the document, the applicable Certificate
Authority, or any other third party; and (c) a certificate may be a self-signed certificate not provided by a
Certificate Authority. CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY
ON A CERTIFICATE. UNLESS A SEPARATE WRITTEN WARRANTY IS PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER BY A
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY, CUSTOMER'S USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT ITS SOLE RISK.
16.5.4 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Customer agrees that any Certificate Authority which the Customer
relies upon is a third-party beneficiary of this agreement and shall have the right to enforce this
agreement in its own name as if it were Adobe.
--- Page 109 ---
16.5.5 Indemnity. Customer agrees to hold Adobe and any applicable Certificate Authority (except as
expressly provided in its terms and conditions) harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, actions,
damages, or claims (including all reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys’ fees) arising out of or
relating to Customer’s use of, or any reliance on, any service of such authority, including, without
limitation: (a) reliance on an expired or revoked certificate; (b) improper verification of a certificate,
(c) use of a certificate other than as permitted by any applicable terms and conditions, this agreement or
applicable law; (d) failure to exercise reasonable judgment under the circumstances in relying on issuer

agrees that it will not copy, move, activate or use, or allow any font management tool to copy, move,
activate or use, such listed fonts in or with any software application, program, or file other than the
Software.
16.7 After Effects Render Engine. If the Software includes the full version of Adobe After Effects, then
Customer may install an unlimited number of Render Engines on Computers within its Internal Network

2. Software License; Membership.
2.1 Software License. This Section 2.1 applies to Customers who have purchased a license to the
Software but have not purchased a membership-based license or service such as the Creative Cloud
membership (as described in Section 2.2).
2.1.1 License Grant. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance with this Agreement and payment of
the applicable license fees, Adobe grants Customer a non-exclusive and limited license to install and use
the Software (a) in the territory or region where Customer obtains the Software from Adobe or Adobe’s
authorized reseller or as otherwise stated in the Documentation (“Territory”), (b) during the term of such
license (“License Term”), (c) within the scope of the License Type and on the Permitted Number of
Customer’s Compatible Computers as specified in the Documentation, and (d) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and applicable Documentation. Unless otherwise defined in this
Agreement, in the applicable Documentation, or at the time of purchase, License Term shall be
perpetual. Upon the expiration or termination of the License Term, some or all of the Software may
cease to operate without prior notice. Upon expiration or termination of the License Term, Customer
may not use the Software unless Customer has renewed the license. The license granted herein is
supplemented by specific provisions in Section 16 as related to the use of certain applicable products
and components that may be included in the Software such as font software, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite, and Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 License Types.
2.1.2.1 Non-Serialized Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided without a
serial number during the License Term may only be installed and used on any number of Compatible
Computers as part of an organizational deployment plan during the License Term for demonstration,
evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any Output Files or other materials produced through
such use are used only for internal, non-commercial, and non-production purposes. THE NON-
SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS-IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED
WITH SUCH NON-SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.
2.1.2.2 Evaluation Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided with a serial
number designated for “evaluation purposes” or other similar designation (such as Software or a serial
number supplied as “EVAL” under a separate agreement) (“Evaluation Software”) may only be installed
and used on Permitted Number of Compatible Computers during the License Term for demonstration,
evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any Output Files or other materials produced through
such use are used only for internal, non-commercial, and non-production purposes. THE EVALUATION
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED WITH SUCH
EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.
2.1.2.3 Subscription Edition. For the Software available on a subscription-basis (“Subscription Edition”),
Customer may install and use the Subscription Edition only on the Permitted Number of Compatible
Computer during the License Term. Subject to the Permitted Number of Computers for the Subscription
Edition, Adobe may allow Customer to install and use the most recent prior version of the Subscription
Edition and the current version of the Subscription Edition on the same Computer during the License
--- Page 114 ---
Term. Customer agrees that Adobe may change the type of Software (such as specific components,
versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in the Subscription Edition at any time and shall not be
liable to Customer whatsoever for such change. Ongoing access to a Subscription Edition requires: (a) a
recurring Internet connection to activate, renew, and validate the license, (b) Adobe or its authorized
reseller’s receipt of recurring subscription payments, and (c) Customer’s agreement to subscription
terms and other additional terms and conditions that are available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms or at the time of purchase. If Adobe does not receive the
recurring subscription payment or cannot validate the license periodically, then the Software may
become inactive without additional notice until Adobe receives the payment or validates the license.
2.1.3 Portable or Home Computer Use. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.1.4, the
primary user of the Computer on which the Software is installed under Section 2.1 (“Primary User”)
may install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on either a portable Computer
or a Computer located at his or her home, provided that the Software on the portable or home
Computer is not used at the same time as the Software on the primary Computer.
2.1.4 Restrictions on Secondary Use by Volume Licensees. If the Software was obtained under an Adobe
volume license program or agreement (such as Adobe Volume Licensing) by any licensee other than an
educational volume licensee, then the second copy of the Software made under Section 2.1.3 must be
used solely for the benefit and business of that volume licensee.
2.1.5 Dual Boot Platform. The Software is licensed for use on a specific operating system platform.
Customer must purchase a separate license for use of the Software on each operating system platform.
By way of example, if Customer desires to install the Software on both the Mac OS and Windows
operating system platforms on a device that runs both of those platforms (i.e., a dual boot machine),
then Customer must first obtain two separate licenses for the Software. This is true even if two versions
of the Software, each designed for a different operating system platform, are delivered to Customer on
the same media.
2.1.6 Distribution from a Server. As permitted by the Documentation, Customer may copy an image of
the Software onto a Computer file server within Customer’s Internal Network (“Server”) for the purpose
of downloading and installing the Software onto Computers within the same Internal Network for use
only as permitted by this Section 2.
2.1.7 Server Use.
2.1.7.1 As permitted in a separate purchasing document or Documentation and subject to license
restrictions stated in this Agreement, Customer may install the Software on a Server only for the
purpose of allowing an individual from a Computer within the same Internal Network (“Network User”)
to access and use the Software. The Network User who has access to such Software on the Server is
referred to as “Server Software User”. The total number of Server Software Users (not the concurrent
number of users) may not exceed the Permitted Number. By way of example, if Customer has
purchased 10 licenses of Software (Permitted Number is 10) and Customer elects to install the Software
on a Server, then Customer can only allow up to 10 Server Software Users the access to the Software
(even though Customer may have more than 10 Network Users or fewer than 10 concurrent users of
the Software).
2.1.7.2 For clarification and without limitation, the foregoing does not permit Customer to install or
access (either directly or through commands, data, or instructions) the Software: (a) from or to a
Computer not part of Customer’s Internal Network; (b) for enabling web hosted workgroups or web
hosted services available to the public; (c) by any individual or entity to use, download, copy, or
otherwise benefit from the functionality of the Software unless licensed to do so by Adobe; (d) as a
component of a system, workflow or service accessible by more than the Permitted Number of users; or
(e) for operations not initiated by an individual user (e.g., automated server processing).
2.2 Membership. This Section 2.2 applies to Customers who have purchased a membership-based
license or service such as the Creative Cloud membership (collectively, “Membership”).
--- Page 115 ---
2.2.1 Adobe Online Services Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance
with this Agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer a
non-exclusive, Territory-wide and limited right to access and use the Software and related Adobe
Online Service (as further described in Section 16.4.1) as part of the Membership, subject to the terms
stated in this Agreement and the Additional Terms of Use (as the term is defined in Section 14.1.3
below).
2.2.2 Software License Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance with
this Agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer a non-
exclusive and limited license to install and use the Software: (a) in the Territory, (b) during the period
that the Membership is current and active (“Membership Term”) and (c) in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and applicable Documentation. Upon the expiration or termination of the
Membership Term, (x) some or all of the Software may cease to operate without prior notice and
(y) Customer may not use the Software unless Customer has renewed the membership. All terms
related to the specific Software as stated in this Agreement shall remain effective and continue to apply
to Customer and its use of such Software.
2.2.3 Restrictions. Customer agrees to the following additional terms and restrictions related to the
Membership: (a) Adobe may change the type of Software (such as specific products, components,
versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in the Membership at any time and shall not be liable to
Customer whatsoever for such change; (b) Customer may be required to connect to the Internet and log
in at any time during the Membership Term; (c) Software may automatically connect to the Internet to
verify Customer’s Membership without notice at any time; and (d) Customer may not enable or allow
others to use the Software as Customer.
2.3 Content Files. Unless stated otherwise in the “Read-Me” files, Documentation, or other license(s)
associated with the Content Files, Customer may use, display, modify, reproduce, and distribute any of
the Content Files. However, Customer may not distribute the Content Files on a stand-alone basis (i.e.,
in circumstances in which the Content Files constitute the primary value of the product being
distributed), and Customer may not claim any trademark rights in the Content Files or derivative works
thereof. Nothing stated herein shall affect the ownership of the Software as stated in Section 3.
2.4 Sample Application Code. Customer may modify the source code form of those portions of the
Software programs that are expressly identified as sample code, sample application code, code snippets,
ActionScript class files, or sample components (each, “Sample Application Code”) in the accompanying
Documentation solely for the purposes of designing, developing, and testing websites and applications
developed using Adobe software programs; provided, however, Customer is permitted to copy and
distribute the Sample Application Code (modified or unmodified) only if all of the following conditions
are met: (a) Customer distributes only the compiled object code versions of the Sample Application
Code with its application; (b) Customer does not include the Sample Application Code in any product or
application designed for website development; and (c) Customer does not use the Adobe name, logos,
icons, or other Adobe trademarks to market its application. Customer agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s
fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of its application.
2.5 Programming Languages. The Software may include portions of the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK. Subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 2, Adobe grants to Customer a
nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the items in the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK only for the purpose of internal development of application programs designed to function
with Adobe products. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.5, no portions of the ExtendScript
SDK or the Pixel Bender SDK may be modified or distributed. Customer agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s
fees, that arise or result from such distribution.
--- Page 116 ---
2.6 Documentation Copies. Customer may make copies of the Documentation for its own internal use in
connection with use of the Software in accordance with this agreement, but no more than the amount
reasonably necessary.
3. Intellectual Property Ownership.
The Software and any authorized copies that Customer makes are the intellectual property of and are
owned by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The structure, organization, and source code
of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Adobe Systems
Incorporated and its suppliers. The Software is protected by law, including but not limited to the
copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as
expressly stated herein, this agreement does not grant Customer any intellectual property rights in the
Software. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Adobe and its suppliers.

reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the
Software.
4.5 No Unbundling. The Software may include various applications and components, may allow access
to different Adobe Online Services, may support multiple platforms and languages, and may be
provided to Customer on multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the Software is designed
and provided to Customer as a single product to be used as a single product on Computers as permitted
herein. Unless otherwise permitted in the Documentation, Customer is not required to install all
component parts of the Software, but Customer may not unbundle the component parts of the Software
for use on different Computers.
4.6 No Transfer.
4.6.1 CUSTOMER WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN, OR TRANSFER ITS RIGHTS IN
THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, SOFTWARE OBTAINED THROUGH A WEB
DOWNLOAD), OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN.
4.6.2 Except with regard to Educational Software Products (as defined in Section 16.3), Pre-release
Software (as defined in Section 16.2), Evaluation Software, not-for-resale copies of the Software, or
Software obtained through an Adobe volume license program and further subject to Section 4.6.3,
Customer may permanently transfer all its rights to use the Software to another individual or legal entity
provided that: (a) Customer also transfers (i) this agreement, (ii) the serial number(s), the Software
affixed to media provided by Adobe or its authorized distributor, and all other software or hardware
bundled, packaged, or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and Prior Versions
(as defined in Section 5, below), and (iii) all copies of font software to such individual or entity;
(b) Customer retains no Updates, Prior Versions, or copies, including backups and copies stored on a

--- Page 117 ---
terms and conditions under which Customer purchased a valid license to the Software. Additional
information on transferring volume licensed software is available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies.
4.6.3 If the Software requires recurring activation or registration and Adobe grants Customer’s request to
be exempted from the requirement of such recurring activation or registration, then in addition to the
restrictions set forth in the Activation Terms (as defined in Section 14.3), then the right to permanently
transfer as stated in Section 4.6.2 shall terminate immediately upon the grant of such request.
4.7 No Service Bureau. Customer will not use or offer the Software on a service bureau basis.
Section 16.6.3 provides a limited exception for font software only.
4.8 Adobe Runtime Restrictions. Customer will not use Adobe Runtimes on any non-PC device or with
any embedded or device version of any operating system. For the avoidance of doubt, and by example
only, Customer may not use Adobe Runtimes on any (a) mobile device, set top box, handheld, phone,
game console, TV, DVD player, media center (other than with Windows XP Media Center Edition and its

Territory and in a manner consistent with the activation policy described at
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation. Adobe may terminate the license granted herein or suspend the
Membership or access to the Adobe Online Services if Adobe determines that Customer is using the
Software or Adobe Online Services outside the Territory.
5. Updates.
If the Software is an Update to a prior version of Adobe software (the “Prior Version”), then Customer’s
use of this Update is conditional upon its retention of the Prior Version. Therefore, if Customer validly
transfers this Update pursuant to Section 4.6, the Customer must transfer the Prior Version along with it.
If Customer wishes to use this Update in addition to the Prior Version, then Customer may only do so on
the same Computer on which it has installed and is using the Prior Version. Any obligations that Adobe
may have to support Prior Versions during the License Term may end upon the availability of this
Update. No other use of the Update is permitted. Additional Updates may be licensed to Customer by
Adobe with additional or different terms.
6. Limited Warranty.
Except as otherwise stated in a separate agreement between Adobe and a Software licensee, Adobe
warrants to the individual or entity that first purchases a license for the Software for use pursuant to the
terms of this agreement that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the
corresponding user manual for the Software for the shorter period of (a) the ninety (90) day period or
(b) License Term following receipt of the Software (“Warranty Period”) when used on the Compatible
Computer. Non-substantial variation of performance from the user manual does not establish a
warranty right. This limited warranty does not apply to the following, which are made available AS-IS
and without warranty from Adobe: (i) patches; (ii) font software; (iii) Pre-release Software, trial, starter,
evaluation, product sampler, Evaluation Software, and not-for-resale copies of the Software;
(iv) websites, Adobe Online Services; and Third Party Online Services; (v) Certified Document Services
(see Section 16); and (vi) any software made available by Adobe for free via web download from an
Adobe website. All warranty claims must be made, along with proof of purchase, to the Adobe
Customer Support Department within such Warranty Period. Additional information on warranty claims
is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/support. The entire liability of Adobe and its affiliates related
--- Page 118 ---
to such warranty claim and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy under any warranty will be limited to
either, at Adobe’s option, support of the Software based on the warranty claim, replacement of the
Software, or, if support or replacement is not practicable at Adobe’s determination, refund of the license
fee Customer paid for the Software (if any). THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION
GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER
LAW WHICH MAY VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT
CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. Please see Section 16
for jurisdiction-specific provisions or contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.
7. Disclaimer.
THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 6 AND ANY STATUTORY WARRANTY AND REMEDY THAT
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER LAW ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE. OTHER THAN THOSE OFFERED AND STATUTORY
WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES
(DEFINED BELOW) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND TERMS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE, OR OTHERWISE AS
TO ANY MATTER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY
QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. OTHER THAN SUCH OFFERED AND
STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, THE SOFTWARE AND ACCESS TO ANY WEBSITES, ADOBE
OR THIRD PARTY ONLINE SERVICES, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS
AND WITH ALL FAULTS. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME
JURISDICTIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH MAY
NOT BE WAIVED OR DISCLAIMED. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY
RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. The provisions of Sections 7 and Section 8 will
survive the termination of this agreement, howsoever caused, but this will not imply or create any
continued right to use the Software after termination of this agreement.
8. Limitation of Liability.
EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OFFERED BY ADOBE ABOVE AND ANY REMEDIES THAT
CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER LAW, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS,
OR COSTS WHATSOEVER INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
PERSONAL INJURY OR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY OF CARE, OR CLAIMS BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN
IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES,
CLAIMS, OR COSTS. IN ANY EVENT, ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS AFFILIATES,
SUPPLIERS, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY
EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL BREACH OR A BREACH OF THE
FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. Nothing contained in this agreement
limits Adobe’s liability to Customer in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe’s
negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its affiliates, suppliers, and
Certificate Authorities for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and limiting obligations, warranties, and
liability, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW IN CUSTOMER’S JURISDICTION. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME
JURISDICTIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED UNDER CONSUMER
PROTECTION AND OTHER LAWS. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT ITS WARRANTY OR REMEDIES TO
ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. SEE SECTION 16 FOR JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC STATEMENTS.

administrative, or other authority to order any provisional or conservatory measure, including injunctive
relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief, prior to the institution of legal or arbitration
proceedings, or during the proceedings, for the preservation of its rights and interests or to enforce
specific terms that are suitable for provisional remedies. This agreement will not be governed by the

jurisdiction, (y) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and
(z) the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, as enacted in any jurisdiction.
11. General Provisions.

Sections 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and
Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users
(a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users
pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of
the United States.
13. Compliance with Licenses.
If Customer is a business, company, or organization, Customer agrees that, in addition to any license
compliance checking performed by the Software, Adobe or its authorized representative have the right,
no more than once every twelve (12) months, upon seven (7) business days’ prior notice to Customer,
to inspect Customer’s records, systems, and facilities to verify that its use of any and all Adobe software
or service is in conformity with its valid licenses from Adobe. For example, Adobe has the right to those
of Customer’s records useful to determine whether installations of the Software have been serialized,
and Customer shall provide such records to Adobe promptly upon request by Adobe. Additionally,
Customer shall provide Adobe with all records and information requested by Adobe in order to verify
that its use of any and all Adobe software is in conformity with its valid licenses from Adobe within
thirty (30) days of Adobe’s request. Additional information on serialization is available at
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing.
14. Internet Connectivity and Privacy.
14.1 Automatic Connections to the Internet. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without
notice, to automatically connect to the Internet and to communicate with an Adobe website or Adobe
domain for purposes such as license validation and providing Customer with additional information,
features, or functionality. Unless otherwise specified in Sections 14.2 through 14.7, the following
provisions apply to all automatic Internet connections by the Software:
14.1.1 Whenever the Software makes an Internet connection and communicates with an Adobe
website, whether automatically or due to explicit user request, the Privacy Policy shall apply. Adobe
Privacy Policy allows tracking of website visits and it addresses in detail the topic of tracking and use of
cookies, web beacons, and similar devices.
14.1.2 Whenever the Software connects to Adobe over the Internet, certain Customer information is
collected and transmitted by the Software to Adobe pursuant to the Adobe Online Privacy Policy
available at http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy (“Privacy Policy”).
--- Page 121 ---
14.1.3 If Customer accesses an Adobe Online Service (as defined in Section 16.4 below) or activates or
registers the Software, then additional information such as Customer’s Adobe ID, user name, and
password may be transmitted to and stored by Adobe pursuant to the Privacy Policy and additional
terms of use related to such Adobe Online Service (collectively with the Adobe.com terms of use and
any applicable terms, the “Additional Terms of Use”).
14.1.4 As permitted by applicable law or as consented to by Customer, Adobe may (a) send Customer
transactional messages to facilitate the Adobe Online Service or the activation or registration of the
Software or Adobe Online Service, or (b) deliver in-product marketing to provide information about the
Software and other Adobe products and Services using information including but not limited to platform
version, version of the Software, license status, and language.
14.2 Updating. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice, to
automatically connect to the Internet (intermittently or on a regular basis) to (a) check for Updates that
are available for download to and installation on the Computer and (b) notify Adobe of the results of
installation attempts.
14.3 Activation. The Software may require Customer to (a) obtain an Adobe ID, (b) activate or reactivate
the Software, (c) register the software, or (d) validate the Membership. Such requirement may cause
Customer’s Computer to connect to the Internet without notice on install, on launch, and on a regular
basis thereafter. Once connected, the Software will collect and transmit information to Adobe as further
described at http://www.adobe.com/go/activation (“Activation Terms”). Software or Customer may also
receive information from Adobe related to Customer’s license, subscription, or Membership. Adobe
may use such information to detect or prevent fraudulent or unauthorized use not in accordance with a
valid license, subscription, or Membership. Failure to activate or register the Software, validate the
subscription or Membership, or a determination by Adobe of fraudulent or unauthorized use of the
Software may result in reduced functionality, inoperability of the Software, or a termination or
suspension of the subscription or Membership.
14.4 Deactivation. Customer may deactivate and uninstall the Software from its Computer in order to
install and activate the Software on another Computer in accordance with this agreement
(“Deactivation”) and as further described in http://www.adobe.com/go/activation. Deactivation requires
Internet connectivity.
14.5 Use of Online Services. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice
and on an intermittent or regular basis, to automatically connect to the Internet to facilitate Customer’s
access to content and services that are provided by Adobe or third parties as further described in
Section 16.4 (Online Services). In addition, the Software may, without additional notice, automatically
connect to the Internet to update downloadable materials from these online services so as to provide
immediate availability of these services even when Customer is offline.
14.6 Digital Certificates. The Software uses digital certificates (as described in Section 16.5) to help
Customer identify downloaded files (e.g., applications and content) and the publishers of those files. For
example, Adobe AIR uses digital certificates to help Customer identify the publisher of Adobe AIR
applications. The Adobe Acrobat family of products also uses digital certificates to sign and validate
signatures within Portable Document Format (“PDF”) documents and to validate certified PDF
documents. Customer’s Computer may connect to the Internet at the time of validation of a digital
certificate.
14.7 Settings Manager. The Software may include Flash Player. Flash Player may save certain user
settings by storing them on Customer’s Computer as a local shared object. They are associated with the
instance of Flash Player on the Computer, allowing Customer to customize runtime features. The Flash
Player Settings Manager permits Customer to modify such settings, including the ability to limit third
parties from storing local shared objects or grant third party content the right to access the computer’s
microphone and camera. Additional information on how to configure settings in its version of Flash
Player, including information on how to disable local shared objects using the Flash Player Settings
--- Page 122 ---
Manager, is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager. Additional information on local
shared objects is available at http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security.
15. Peer-to-Peer Communications.
The Software may use Customer’s connection to a local area network, without additional notice, to
automatically connect to other Adobe software and, in doing so, may indicate on the local area network
that it is available for communication with other Adobe software. These connections may transmit the
IP Address of Customer’s connection to the local network.
16. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.
This section sets forth specific provisions related to certain products and components of the Software as
well as limited exceptions to the above terms and conditions. To the extent that any provision in this
section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, the terms stated in this section
will supersede such other term or condition.
16.1 No Prejudice; European Economic Area Provisions; Australia Mandatory Notice.
16.1.1 This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those dealing as
consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software for personal,
domestic, or household use (not business purposes), this agreement is subject to the Consumer
Guarantees Act.
16.1.2 If Customer obtained the Software in the European Economic Area (EEA), Customer usually
resides in the EEA and Customer is a consumer (that is its use of the Software is for personal, non-
business related purposes), then Section 6 (Limited Warranty) does not apply to Customer’s purchase
and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for a period of 2 years from purchase that the Software
provides the functionalities set forth in the applicable user manual (the “agreed upon functionalities”)
when used on the Compatible Computer. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon
functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO
SOFTWARE THAT CUSTOMER USES ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, OR PRODUCT SAMPLER
BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE, OR TO THE EXTENT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT
HAS BEEN ALTERED BY CUSTOMER. To make a warranty claim, Customer must notify the Adobe
Customer Support Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of purchase of the
Software. Adobe will verify with Customer whether there is a defect in the Software or advise Customer
that the error arises because Customer has not installed the Software correctly (in which case, Adobe
shall assist Customer). If there is a defect in the Software, Customer may request from Adobe either a
refund or a repaired or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied by proof of
purchase. In the event Customer’s warranty details are substantiated, Adobe will meet Customer’s
request for repaired or replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for Adobe to do so, in which
case Adobe will provide Customer with a refund. For warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe
Customer Support Department.
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any
damages claims Customer makes in respect of its use of the Software. Nonetheless, Adobe shall be
liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach by Adobe of this
agreement. Customer is advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in
particular by making back-up copies of the Software and its computer data.
This agreement, and in particular this Section 16.1.2, is intended to describe Customer’s rights (including
its statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with its use of the Software. If Customer’s
statutory rights are greater than this description, its statutory rights shall apply.
16.1.3 Nothing included in this agreement (including Section 4.4) shall limit any non-waivable right to
decompile the Software that Customer may enjoy under applicable law. For example, if Customer is
--- Page 123 ---
located in the European Union (EU), Customer may have the right upon certain conditions specified in
the applicable law to decompile the Software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve
interoperability of the Software with another software program, and Customer has first asked Adobe in
writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such operability and Adobe has not made such
information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be performed by Customer or someone
else entitled to use a copy of the Software on Customer’s behalf. Adobe has the right to impose
reasonable conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Adobe or
obtained by Customer, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by Customer for the purpose
described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software that is
substantially similar to the expression of the Software or used for any other act that infringes the
copyright of Adobe or its licensors.
16.1.4 If Customer obtains the Software in Australia, then the following provision shall apply,
notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this Agreement:
NOTICE TO CONSUMERS IN AUSTRALIA:
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are
entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably
foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods
fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure. Our software products
also come with a 90-day limited warranty given by Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, with an
office at 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin, Ireland, as set out in the Agreement. If your
products do not provide the general features and functions described in the User Documentation in the
90-day period after delivery to you, please call the Adobe Customer Support Department at
1800 614 863 with details of your product, serial number, and proof of purchase. You may be required
to return the software product to the address we provide to you at the time, in which case such return
will be at your own cost. The benefits under this warranty are in addition to other rights and remedies
that you may have at law.
16.2 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software
(“Pre-release Software”), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software does not represent final
product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or
other failures and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. If
Customer received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the
Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release Software, then Customer’s use of the
Software is also governed by such agreement. Customer will promptly return or destroy all copies of
Pre-release Software upon the earlier of Adobe’s request or upon Adobe’s commercial release of such
Software. CUSTOMER’S USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT ITS OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 6 AND 8
FOR LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS RELATED TO PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
16.3 Educational Software Product. If the Software is Educational Software Product (Software
manufactured and distributed for use only by Educational End Users), Customer is not entitled to use
the Software unless Customer qualify in its jurisdiction as an Educational End User. Please visit
http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing to learn about eligibility. Please visit
http://www.adobe.com/go/store and look for the link for Buying Adobe Products Worldwide to find an
Adobe Authorized Academic Reseller.
16.4 Online Services.
16.4.1 Provided by Adobe. The Software facilitates Customer’s access to content and various services
that are hosted on websites maintained by Adobe or its affiliates (“Adobe Online Services”). Examples of
such Adobe Online Services might include, but are not limited to: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS
Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help, and product Welcome
Screens. In some cases an Adobe Online Service might appear as a feature or extension within the
Software even though it is hosted on a website. Access to an Adobe Online Service may require
Customer to activate the Software, obtain an Adobe ID, consent to Additional Terms of Use, or require a
--- Page 124 ---
separate fee in order to access such Adobe Online Services. Adobe Online Services might not be
available in all languages or to residents of all countries and Adobe may, at any time and for any reason,
modify or discontinue the availability of any Adobe Online Service. Adobe also reserves the right to
begin charging a fee for access to or use of an Adobe Online Service that was previously offered at no
charge. Section 14 states important information regarding Internet connectivity and Customer’s privacy.
As stated in Section 14, when the Software accesses an Adobe Online Service, Customer’s use of such
Adobe Online Service is governed by the Adobe Privacy Policy (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy), by
the Adobe.com Terms of Use (http://www.adobe.com/go/terms), and by any Additional Terms of Use
that might be presented to Customer at that time.
16.4.2 Provided by Third Parties. The Software may facilitate Customer’s access to websites maintained
by third parties offering goods, information, software, and services (“Third Party Online Services”).
Examples of such Third Party Online Services might include, but are not limited to, the Kodak EasyShare
Gallery service. Customer’s access to and use of any Third Party Online Services is governed by the
terms, conditions, disclaimers, and notices found on such site or otherwise associated with such Third
Party Online Services. Adobe does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility for Third Party Online
Services. Any dealings between Customer and any third party in connection with a Third Party Online
Service, including such party’s privacy policies and use of Customer’s personal information, delivery of
and payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations
associated with such dealings, are solely between Customer and such third party. Third Party Online
Services might not be available in all languages or to residents of all countries and Adobe may, at any
time and for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any Third Party Online Service.
16.4.3 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED BY ADOBE OR ITS AFFILIATES OR A THIRD PARTY IN A
SEPARATE AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER’S USE OF ADOBE ONLINE SERVICES AND THIRD PARTY ONLINE
SERVICES IS AT ITS OWN RISK UNDER THE WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 7
AND 8.
16.5 Digital Certificates.
16.5.1 Use. Digital certificates are issued by third party certificate authorities, including Adobe Certified
Document Services (CDS) vendors listed at http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds and Adobe
Approved Trust List vendors (“AATL”) listed at http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl (collectively “Certificate
Authorities”), or can be self-signed.
16.5.2 Terms and Conditions. Purchase, use, and reliance upon digital certificates is the responsibility of
Customer and a Certificate Authority. Before Customer relies upon any certified document, digital
signature, or Certificate Authority services, Customer should review the applicable terms and conditions
under which the relevant Certificate Authority provides services, including, for example, any subscriber
agreements, relying party agreements, certificate policies, and practice statements. See the links on

http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl for information about AATL vendors.
16.5.3 Acknowledgement. Customer agrees that (a) the Software, due to configuration or external
issues, might show a signature as valid despite the fact a digital certificate may have been revoked or
expired prior to the time of verification; (b) the security or integrity of a digital certificate may be
compromised due to an act or omission by the signer of the document, the applicable Certificate
Authority, or any other third party; and (c) a certificate may be a self-signed certificate not provided by a
Certificate Authority. CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY
ON A CERTIFICATE. UNLESS A SEPARATE WRITTEN WARRANTY IS PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER BY A
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY, CUSTOMER'S USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT ITS SOLE RISK.
16.5.4 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Customer agrees that any Certificate Authority which the Customer
relies upon is a third-party beneficiary of this agreement and shall have the right to enforce this
agreement in its own name as if it were Adobe.
--- Page 125 ---
16.5.5 Indemnity. Customer agrees to hold Adobe and any applicable Certificate Authority (except as
expressly provided in its terms and conditions) harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, actions,
damages, or claims (including all reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys’ fees) arising out of or
relating to Customer’s use of, or any reliance on, any service of such authority, including, without
limitation: (a) reliance on an expired or revoked certificate; (b) improper verification of a certificate,

agrees that it will not copy, move, activate or use, or allow any font management tool to copy, move,
activate or use, such listed fonts in or with any software application, program, or file other than the
Software.
16.7 After Effects Render Engine. If the Software includes the full version of Adobe After Effects, then
Customer may install an unlimited number of Render Engines on Computers within its Internal Network

1.3 ”Yhteensopiva tietokone” tarkoittaa tietokonetta, jossa on suositeltu käyttöjärjestelmä ja
dokumentaatiossa ilmaistut laitteiston määritykset.
1.4 ”Tietokone” tarkoittaa virtuaalista tai fyysistä laitetta, joka hyväksyy tietoa digitaalisessa tai sitä
vastaavassa muodossa ja käsittelee tätä tietoa sille annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti tietyn tuloksen
aikaansaamiseksi. Tietokoneisiin luetaan rajoituksetta mukaan pöytätietokoneet, kannettavat
tietokoneet, tablet-tietokoneet, mobiililaitteet, televiestimet, Internetiin yhdistyvät laitteistot sekä
laitteistotuotteet, joissa toimivat monet erityyppiset tuotanto-, viihde- ja muut ohjelmistosovellukset.
1.5 ”Käyttäjä” tarkoittaa sinua ja ketä tahansa oikeushenkilöä, joka on hankkinut ohjelmiston ja jonka
puolesta ohjelmistoa käytetään; tämä voi, soveltuvissa tapauksissa, olla esimerkiksi työnantajasi.
1.6 ”Sisäinen verkko” tarkoittaa yksityistä tietoverkkoa, johon on pääsy ainoastaan tietyn yhtiön tai
vastaavan liiketoimintayksikön työntekijöillä ja yksittäisillä sopimuskumppaneilla (kuten tilapäisillä
työntekijöillä). Sisäinen verkko ei käsitä Internetin osia tai muuta yleisölle avointa verkkoyhteisöä, kuten
jäsenyyteen tai tilaukseen perustuvat ryhmät, yhdistykset ja vastaavat organisaatiot.
1.7 ”Tulostustiedosto” tarkoittaa käyttäjän ohjelmiston avulla luomaa tulostustiedostoa.
--- Page 129 ---
1.8 ”Sallittu lukumäärä” tarkoittaa yhtä (1), mikäli voimassa oleva Adoben myöntämä käyttöoikeus
(esimerkiksi määrälisenssi) ei toisin määrää.
1.9 ”Ohjelmisto” tarkoittaa (a) kaikkea tämän sopimuksen yhteydessä toimitettua tietoa, mukaan lukien
seuraavat tiedot mutta ei näihin rajoittuen: (i) kaikki ohjelmistotiedostot ja tietokoneisiin liittyvät tiedot,
(ii) kaikki suojattujen komentosarjojen logiikka, jota käytetään Adoben online-palvelussa tai joka
sisältyy vietyihin tiedostomuotoihin; (iii) näyte- ja varusvalokuvat, kuvat, äänitiedostot, Clip Art -kuvat ja
muut taiteelliset tuotokset, jotka kuuluvat Adobe-ohjelmistoihin tai jotka Adobe on laittanut Adoben
verkkosivustolle käytettäväksi Adoben ohjelmistojen kanssa ja joita ei ole hankittu Adobelta jonkin
erillispalvelun kautta (ellei palvelussa toisin mainita) tai muulta osapuolelta (”sisältötiedostot”);
(iv) kirjalliset selittävät materiaalit ja tiedostot (”dokumentaatio”); ja (v) fontit; ja (b) kaikki mainitun
tiedon muokatut versiot ja kopiot, parannukset, päivitykset ja lisäykset (yleisemmin ”päivitykset”), jotka
Adobe on toimittanut käyttäjälle milloin tahansa, siinä laajuudessa kuin ei ole erillisellä sopimuksella
sovittu.
2. Ohjelmiston käyttöoikeus; jäsenyys.
2.1 Ohjelmiston käyttöoikeus. Kohta 2.1 tarkoittaa käyttäjiä, jotka ovat ostaneet käyttöoikeuden
ohjelmistoon mutta eivät ole ostaneet jäsenyyteen perustuvaa käyttöoikeutta tai palvelua, kuten
Creative Cloude -jäsenyyttä (kuten kuvattu kohdassa 2.2).
2.1.1 Ohjelmiston käyttöoikeus. Mikäli käyttäjä noudattaa aina sopimusta ja maksaa soveltuvan
käyttöoikeusmaksun, Adobe myöntää käyttäjälle ei-yksinomaisen oikeuden asentaa ohjelmiston ja
käyttää sitä (a) sillä alueella, jossa käyttäjä hankkii ohjelmiston Adobelta tai Adoben valtuuttamalta
jälleenmyyjältä tai muulla dokumentaatiossa ilmoitetulla tavalla (”alue”); (b) sinä aikana, kun kyseinen
käyttöoikeus on voimassa (”käyttöoikeuden voimassaoloaika”); (c) lisenssityypin rajoitusten mukaisesti
ja sallitussa lukumäärässä ohjelmiston kanssa yhteensopivia tietokoneita (kuten dokumentaatiossa on
eritelty); ja (d) tässä sopimuksessa ja sovellettavassa dokumentaatiossa olevien ehtojen mukaisesti.
Mikäli sopimuksessa, soveltuvassa dokumentaatiossa tai oston hetkellä ei muuta määrätä,
käyttöoikeussopimuksen voimassaoloaika on jatkuva. Käyttöoikeussopimuksen voimassaoloajan
kuluttua umpeen osa ohjelmistosta tai koko ohjelmisto voi lakata toimimasta ilman ennakkovaroitusta.
Käyttöoikeussopimuksen voimassaoloajan kuluttua umpeen käyttäjä ei voi käyttää ohjelmistoa, ellei
hän ole uusinut käyttöoikeutta. Tässä myönnettyyn käyttöoikeuteen kuuluu kohdassa 16 erityisiä
ehtoja, jotka liittyvät joidenkin soveltuvien, ohjelmistoon sisällytettävissä olevien tuotteiden ja
komponenttien käyttöön. Näitä ovat fonttiohjelmisto, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter,
Contribute, Abode Device Central, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Folio Producer ja Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 Lisenssityypit.
2.1.2.1 Ei-sarjanumeroitu ohjelmisto. Ohjelmisto tai ohjelmiston osat, jotka toimitetaan käyttöoikeuden
voimassaoloaikana ilman sarjanumeroa, voidaan asentaa ja niitä voidaan käyttää käyttöoikeuden
voimassaoloaikana kuinka monessa yhteensopivassa tietokoneessa tahansa osana organisaation
käyttöönottosuunnitelmaa esittely-, arviointi- ja koulutustarkoituksia varten vain ja ainoastaan, mikäli
tällaisessa käytössä tuotettuja tulostusmateriaaleja tai muuta materiaalia käytetään ainoastaan sisäisiin,
ei-kaupallisiin ja ei-tuotannollisiin tarkoituksiin. EI-SARJANUMEROITU OHJELMISTO TOIMITETAAN
”SELLAISENAAN”. TÄLLAISELLA EI-SARJANUMEROIDULLA OHJELMISTOLLA LUOTUJEN
TULOSTUSTIEDOSTOJEN AVAAMINEN JA KÄYTTÖ ON KOKONAAN KÄYTTÄJÄN OMALLA
VASTUULLA.
2.1.2.2 Arviointiohjelmisto. Ohjelmisto tai ohjelmiston osat, jotka toimitetaan ”arviointikäyttöön” tai
muuhun vastaavaan tarkoitukseen määrätyllä sarjanumerolla (kuten erillisellä sopimuksella ”EVAL”-
määrityksellä varustettu ohjelmisto tai sarjanumero) (”arviointiohjelmisto”), voidaan asentaa ja käyttää
sallitussa lukumäärässä ohjelmiston kanssa yhteensopivia tietokoneita käyttöoikeuden
voimassaoloaikana vain esittely-, arviointi- ja koulutustarkoituksia varten ja vain, mikäli tällaisessa
käytössä tuotettuja tulostustiedostoja tai muita materiaaleja käytetään ainoastaan sisäisiin, ei-
kaupallisiin ja ei-tuotannollisiin tarkoituksiin. ARVIOINTIOHJELMISTO TOIMITETAAN ”SELLAISENAAN”.
--- Page 130 ---
TÄLLAISELLA ARVIOINTIOHJELMISTOLLA LUOTUJEN TULOSTUSTIEDOSTOJEN AVAAMINEN JA
KÄYTTÖ ON KOKONAAN KÄYTTÄJÄN OMALLA VASTUULLA.
2.1.2.3 Tilattu versio. Tilauksesta saatavilla olevan ohjelmiston kyseessä ollessa (”tilattu versio”) käyttäjä
saa asentaa ja käyttää tilattua versiota vain sallitussa määrässä yhteensopivia tietokoneita
käyttöoikeuden voimassaoloaikana. Tilatulle versiolle sallitusta tietokoneiden lukumäärästä riippuen
Adobe voi antaa käyttäjän asentaa ja käyttää käyttöoikeuden voimassaoloaikana samalla koneella
tilatun version edeltävää uusinta versiota sekä nykyistä versiosta. Käyttäjä suostuu siihen, että Adobe voi
vaihtaa tilattuun versioon kuuluvaa ohjelmistotyyppiä (kuten tiettyjä komponentteja, versioita,
ohjelmistoalustoja, kieliä jne.) milloin tahansa, eikä sitä voida pitää vastuussa käyttäjälle mistään
tämänlaisesta muutoksesta. Tilatun version jatkuva käyttö edellyttää seuraavia asioita: (a) säännöllisesti
käytössä olevaa Internet-yhteyttä, jolla aktivoidaan, uusitaan ja vahvistetaan käyttöoikeus, (b) Adoben
tai sen valtuutetun jälleenmyyjän kuittia säännöllisesti suoritetuista tilausmaksuista, ja (c) sen, että
käyttäjä on hyväksynyt tilausehdot ja muut lisäehdot, jotka ovat saatavilla osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_fi tai oston hetkellä. Mikäli Adobelle ei makseta
säännöllisesti tilausmaksuja eikä se voi vahvistaa käyttöoikeutta määräajoin, ohjelmisto voi lakata
toimimasta ilman ennakkovaroitusta, eikä se toimi uudestaan, ennen kuin Adobe vastaanottaa
tilausmaksun tai vahvistaa käyttöoikeuden.
2.1.3 Käyttö kannettavassa tietokoneessa tai kotitietokoneessa. Ottaen huomioon kohdassa 2.1.4
mainitut rajoitukset, sen tietokoneen ensisijainen käyttäjä, johon ohjelmisto on asennettu
kohdan 2.1 (”ensisijainen käyttäjä”) mukaisesti, voi asentaa toisen kopion ohjelmistosta
yksinomaiseen käyttöönsä kannettavaan tietokoneeseen tai kotitietokoneeseen edellyttäen, että
kannettavassa tietokoneessa tai kotitietokoneessa olevaa ohjelmistoa ei käytetä yhtä aikaa
ensisijaisella tietokoneella olevan ohjelmiston kanssa.
2.1.4 Määrälisenssinhaltijoiden toimesta tapahtuvalle toissijaiselle käytölle asetetut rajoitukset. Mikäli
joku muu käyttöoikeudenhaltija kuin opetuskäyttöä koskeva määrälisenssinhaltija on hankkinut
ohjelmiston Adoben määrälisenssiohjelman tai sopimuksen (kuten Adoben määrälisenssiohjelman)
nojalla, kohdan 2.1.3 mukaisesti valmistettua ohjelmiston kopiota on käytettävä ainoastaan kyseisen
määrälisenssinhaltijan hyväksi ja tämän liiketoimintatarkoituksiin.
2.1.5 Kaksoiskäynnistys eri käyttöjärjestelmissä. Ohjelmistolle myönnetty käyttöoikeus on
käyttöjärjestelmäkohtainen. Ohjelmistosta on ostettava erillinen lisenssi jokaista eri käyttöjärjestelmää
varten. Jos ohjelmisto halutaan esimerkiksi asentaa sekä Mac OS- ja Windows-käyttöjärjestelmiä
käyttävään tietokoneeseen (kaksoiskäynnistys) molemmissa käyttöjärjestelmissä käytettäväksi,
ohjelmasta on hankittava kaksi erillistä lisenssiä. Tämä pätee silloinkin, kun ohjelmistosta toimitetaan
käyttäjälle kaksi erillistä käyttöjärjestelmäversiota samalla tallennusvälineellä.
2.1.6 Jakelu palvelimelta. Kuten dokumentaatiossa sallitaan, käyttäjä voi kopioida ohjelmiston
levykuvan käyttäjän sisäisen verkon tiedostopalvelimelle (”palvelin”) ohjelmiston lataamiseksi ja
asentamiseksi saman sisäisen verkon tietokoneisiin vain kohdassa 2 sallittua käyttöä varten.
2.1.7 Palvelinkäyttö.
2.1.7.1 Kuten erillisessä ostoasiakirjassa tai dokumentaatiossa sallitaan, ja tässä sopimuksessa
ilmoitettujen käyttöoikeusrajoitusten mukaisesti, käyttäjä voi asentaa ohjelmiston palvelimeen vain
antaakseen samaan sisäiseen verkkoon kuuluvan koneen käyttäjän (”verkon käyttäjä”) päästä
käyttämään ohjelmistoa. Verkon käyttäjää, joka pääsee käyttämään ohjelmistoa palvelimen kautta,
kutsutaan ”ohjelmiston palvelinkäyttäjäksi”. Ohjelmiston palvelinkäyttäjien kokonaislukumäärä (joka ei
tarkoita samaa kuin yhtäaikaisten käyttäjien määrä) ei saa ylittää sallittua lukumäärää. Esimerkki: mikäli
käyttäjä on ostanut ohjelmistolle 10 lisenssiä (sallittu määrä on 10) ja käyttäjä päättää asentaa
ohjelmiston palvelimeen, käyttäjä voi antaa korkeintaan 10 ohjelmiston palvelinkäyttäjän käyttää
ohjelmistoa (vaikka käyttäjällä olisi enemmän kuin 10 verkon käyttäjää tai vähemmän kuin 10
ohjelmiston yhtäaikaista käyttäjää).
--- Page 131 ---
2.1.7.2 Selvyyden vuoksi ja rajoituksetta, edellä mainittu ei salli ohjelmiston asennusta tai käyttöä (joko
suoraan tai komentojen, tietojen syötön tai ohjeiden avulla): (a) sisäiseen verkkoon kuulumattomalta
tietokoneelta käsin tai tällaiselle tietokoneelle, (b) verkkosivustolla ylläpidettyjen työryhmien tai
yleisesti käytettävien, verkkosivustolla ylläpidettyjen palvelujen mahdollistamiseksi, (c) kenenkään
henkilön tai oikeushenkilön toimesta, kun tarkoituksena on ohjelmiston käyttö, lataaminen,
kopioiminen tai muu ohjelmiston toiminnallisuuden hyödyntäminen, ellei Adobe ole myöntänyt näihin
toimiin käyttöoikeutta, (d) osana järjestelmää, työnkulkua tai palvelua, joka on useamman käyttäjän
kuin sallitun lukumäärän mukaisen määrän käytettävissä, tai (e) sellaisia toimintoja varten, joita
yksittäinen käyttäjä ei ole aloittanut (esim. automatisoitu palvelinprosessointi).
2.2 Jäsenyys. Kohta 2.2 koskee käyttäjiä, jotka ovat ostaneet jäsenyyteen perustuvan käyttöoikeuden tai
palvelun, kuten Creative Cloude -jäsenyyden (yleisemmin ”jäsenyys”).
2.2.1 Jäsenyyteen liittyvät Adoben online-palvelut. Mikäli käyttäjä noudattaa aina sopimusta ja maksaa
soveltuvat käyttöoikeusmaksut, mikäli niitä on, Adobe myöntää käyttäjälle ei-yksinomaisen, koko
alueen laajuisen ja rajoitetun oikeuden käyttää ohjelmistoa ja siihen liittyvää Adoben online-palvelua
(kuten kuvattu kohdassa 16.4.1) jäsenyyden osana, tässä sopimuksessa olevien ehtojen ja
lisäkäyttöehtojen mukaisesti (kuten ehto on määritelty edempänä kohdassa 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Jäsenyyteen liittyvä ohjelmiston käyttöoikeus. Mikäli käyttäjä noudattaa aina sopimusta ja maksaa
soveltuvat käyttöoikeusmaksut, mikäli niitä on, Adobe takaa käyttäjälle ei-yksinomaisen ja rajoitetun
oikeuden asentaa ja käyttää ohjelmistoa: (a) alueella, (b) sinä aikana, kun jäsenyys on voimassa
(”jäsenyyden voimassaoloaika”), ja (c) tämän sopimuksen ja soveltuvan dokumentaation mukaisesti.
Jäsenyyden voimassaoloajan kuluttua umpeen (x) jotkin osat ohjelmistosta tai koko ohjelmisto voi
lakata toimimasta ilman ennakkovaroitusta, eikä (y) käyttäjä voi käyttää ohjelmistoa ennen kuin on
uudistanut jäsenyytensä. Kaikki ohjelmistoon liittyvät ehdot, kuten ilmoitettu tässä sopimuksessa,
pysyvät voimassa ja niitä sovelletaan sekä käyttäjään että ohjelmiston käyttöön.
2.2.3 Rajoitukset. Käyttäjä suostuu noudattamaan seuraavia jäsenyyteen liittyviä lisäehtoja ja rajoituksia:
(a) Adobe voi muuttaa jäsenyyteen kuuluvaa ohjelmistotyyppiä (kuten tiettyjä tuotteita, komponentteja,
versioita, ohjelmistoalustoja, kieliä jne.) milloin tahansa, eikä sitä voida pitää vastuussa käyttäjälle
mistään tämänlaisesta muutoksesta; (b) käyttäjää voidaan vaatia muodostamaan yhteys Internetiin ja
kirjautumaan milloin tahansa jäsenyyden voimassaoloaikana; (c) ohjelmisto voi ilman erillistä ilmoitusta
muodostaa milloin tahansa automaattisesti yhteyden Internetiin vahvistaakseen käyttäjän jäsenyyden;
ja (d) käyttäjän ei tule sallia, että muut käyttävät ohjelmistoa käyttäjän ominaisuudessa.
2.3 Sisältötiedostot. Mikäli ”Lue minut” -tiedostoissa, dokumentaatiossa tai muissa sisältötiedostoihin
liittyvissä lisensseissä ei muuta määrätä, käyttäjä voi käyttää, tuoda näyttöön, muokata, jäljentää ja jakaa
edelleen kaikkia sisältötiedostoja. Käyttäjä ei kuitenkaan saa levittää sisältötiedostoja erillisinä (toisin
sanoen siten, että sisältötiedostot muodostavat levitettävän tuotteen tärkeimmän osan) eikä hän voi
vaatia tavaramerkkioikeuksia sisältötiedostoihin tai niistä johdettuihin tuotoksiin. Mikään tässä
ilmoitettu ei vaikuta ohjelmiston omistukseen, kuten ilmoitettu kohdassa 3.
2.4 Mallisovelluskoodi. Käyttäjä saa muokata ohjelmistojen sellaisten osien lähdekoodimuotoa, jotka on
erityisesti yksilöity ohjelmiston mukana toimitetussa dokumentaatiossa mallikoodiksi,
mallisovelluskoodiksi, koodinosiksi, ActionScript-luokan tiedostoiksi tai mallikomponenteiksi (kukin
erikseen ”mallisovelluskoodi”), yksinomaan suunnitellakseen, kehittääkseen ja testatakseen Adoben
ohjelmistojen avulla kehitettyjä verkkosivustoja ja sovelluksia, kuitenkin sillä ehdolla, että käyttäjä saa
kopioida ja levittää (muokattua tai muokkaamatonta) mallisovelluskoodia ainoastaan, jos seuraavat
ehdot täyttyvät: (a) käyttäjä levittää vain käännettyjä objektikoodiversioita mallisovelluskoodista
yhdessä oman sovelluksensa kanssa, (b) käyttäjä ei sisällytä mallisovelluskoodia mihinkään sellaiseen
tuotteeseen tai sovellukseen, joka on suunniteltu verkkosivuston kehittämiseen, ja (c) käyttäjä ei käytä
Adoben nimeä, logoja, kuvakkeita tai muita Adoben tavaramerkkejä markkinoidakseen omia
sovelluksiaan. Käyttäjä sitoutuu suojaamaan ja puolustamaan Adobea kaikkia menetyksiä, vahinkoja,
vaatimuksia tai haasteita vastaan ja korvaamaan tällaisesta toiminnasta aiheutuneet kulut, mukaan
lukien asianajopalkkiot, jotka aiheutuvat käyttäjän sovelluksen käytöstä tai levityksestä.
--- Page 132 ---
2.5 Ohjelmointikielet. Ohjelmisto saattaa sisältää ExtendScript SDK- ja Pixel Bender SDK -sovellusten
osia. Adobe myöntää käyttäjälle kohdassa 2 esitetyt rajoitukset huomioiden yleisen, ei-siirrettävän ja
maksuttoman lisenssin ExtendScript SDK- ja Pixel Bender SDK -sovellusten osien käyttämiseksi
ainoastaan Adoben tuotteiden kanssa toimivien sovellusten sisäistä kehitystyötä varten. Käyttäjä ei saa
muokata tai jakaa mitään muita ExtendScript SDK- ja Pixel Bender SDK -sovellusten osia kohdassa 2.5
esitettyjä tietoja lukuun ottamatta. Käyttäjä sitoutuu suojaamaan ja puolustamaan Adobea kaikkia
tappioita, vahinkoja, vaatimuksia tai haasteita vastaan ja korvaamaan tällaisesta aiheutuneet kulut,
mukaan lukien asianajopalkkiot, jotka aiheutuvat kyseisestä levityksestä.
2.6 Dokumentaatiokopiot. Käyttäjä saa tehdä kopioita dokumentaatiosta omaan sisäiseen käyttöönsä
ohjelmiston tämän sopimuksen mukaiseen käyttöön liittyen, mutta ei enempää kuin on kohtuullisesti
tarpeellista.
3. Immateriaalioikeuksien omistus.
Ohjelmisto ja kaikki käyttäjän siitä valmistamat luvalliset kopiot ovat Adobe Systems
Incorporated -yhtiön ja sen toimittajien omaisuutta, joka on immateriaalioikeuksin suojattua.
Ohjelmiston rakenne, järjestely ja lähdekoodi ovat Adobe Systems Incorporated -yhtiön ja sen
toimittajien arvokkaita liikesalaisuuksia ja luottamuksellista tietoa. Ohjelmisto on suojattu lailla (mukaan
lukien, vaikka ei niihin rajoittuen, Yhdysvaltain sekä muiden maiden tekijänoikeuslaki) sekä
kansainvälisillä sopimusmääräyksillä. Ellei tässä sopimuksessa nimenomaisesti muuta todeta, tämä
sopimus ei luo käyttäjälle minkäänlaisia ohjelmistoa koskevia immateriaalioikeuksia. Adobe ja sen
toimittajat pidättävät kaikki oikeudet, joita ei ole tässä sopimuksessa nimenomaan myönnetty.
4. Rajoitukset ja vaatimukset.
4.1 Omistusoikeutta koskevat ilmoitukset. Käyttäjän ohjelmistosta (mukaan lukien rajoituksetta
dokumentaatiosta) tekemien sallittujen kopioiden tulee sisältää samat tekijänoikeutta ja muita
omistusoikeuksia koskevat ilmoitukset, jotka käyvät ilmi ohjelmistosta.
4.2 Käyttäjän velvollisuudet. Käyttäjä hyväksyy, ettei hän saa käyttää ohjelmistoa muulla kuin tässä
sopimuksessa hyväksytyllä tavalla ja ettei hän saa käyttää ohjelmistoa sen käyttötarkoituksista tai
dokumentaatiosta poikkeavalla tavalla.
4.3 Muuttamiskielto. Lukuun ottamatta mitä kohdissa 2 ja 16 nimenomaisesti sallitaan, käyttäjä ei saa
muokata, portata, mukauttaa tai kääntää ohjelmistoa.
4.4 Takaisinmallinnuskielto. Lukuun ottamatta mitä kohdassa 16.1 nimenomaisesti sallitaan, käyttäjä ei
saa takaisinmallintaa, kääntää takaisin, purkaa tai muulla tavoin yrittää selvittää ohjelmiston
lähdekoodia.
4.5 Erottamiskielto. Ohjelmisto voi sisältää erilaisia sovelluksia ja komponentteja, ja se saattaa sallia
pääsyn Adoben erilaisiin online-palveluihin sekä tukea useita ohjelmistoalustoja ja kieliä. Ohjelmisto
voidaan toimittaa käyttäjälle useammalla tallennusvälineellä tai useina kopioina. Tästä huolimatta
ohjelmisto on suunniteltu ja se toimitetaan käyttäjälle yksittäisenä tuotteena käytettäväksi tietokoneissa
yksittäisenä tuotteena, kuten tässä tekstissä sallitaan. Ellei dokumentaatiossa muuta sallita, käyttäjän ei
tarvitse asentaa kaikkia ohjelmiston osia, mutta käyttäjä ei saa erottaa ohjelmiston osia käytettäväksi eri
tietokoneissa.
4.6 Siirtämiskielto.
4.6.1 KÄYTTÄJÄ EI SAA VUOKRATA TAI MYYDÄ OIKEUKSIAAN OHJELMISTOON (MUKAAN LUKIEN
RAJOITUKSETTA KAIKKI VERKOSTA LATAAMALLA SAATU OHJELMISTO), MYÖNTÄÄ NIIHIN
ALIKÄYTTÖOIKEUKSIA, LUOVUTTAA TAI SIIRTÄÄ NIITÄ TAIKKA VALTUUTTAA MINKÄÄN
OHJELMISTON OSAN KOPIOIMISTA TOISEN YKSITYISHENKILÖN TAI OIKEUSHENKILÖN
TIETOKONEELLE, MUUTOIN KUIN TÄSSÄ SOPIMUKSESSA ON NIMENOMAISESTI SALLITTU.
--- Page 133 ---
4.6.2 Opetuskäyttöön tarkoitettuja ohjelmistotuotteita (kuten määritelty kohdassa 16.3),
ennakkojulkaisuohjelmistoa (kuten määritelty kohdassa 16.2), arviointiohjelmistoa, ei-jälleenmyytiin
tarkoitettuja ohjelmistokopioita tai Adoben määrälisenssiohjelman nojalla hankittua ohjelmistoa lukuun
ottamatta sekä kohdan 4.6.3 rajoissa, käyttäjä voi siirtää pysyvästi kaikki oikeutensa ohjelmiston
käyttöön toiselle yksityishenkilölle tai juridiselle henkilölle seuraavien ehtojen mukaisesti: (a) käyttäjä
siirtää kyseiselle henkilölle myös (i) tämän sopimuksen, (ii) sarjanumeron tai -numerot, Adoben tai sen
valtuutettujen jälleenmyyjien toimittamaan tietovälineeseen yhdistetyn ohjelmiston ja kaikki
ohjelmistoon liitetyt tai sen yhteyteen ennalta asennetut ohjelmistot ja laitteet, mukaan lukien kaikki
kopiot, päivitykset ja edeltävät versiot (alla olevassa kohdassa 5 määritetyllä tavalla), ja (iii) kaikki
fonttiohjelmiston kopiot; (b) käyttäjä ei säilytä itsellään mitään päivityksiä, edeltäviä versioita tai
kopioita mukaan lukien varmuuskopiot ja tietokoneelle tallennetut kopiot; ja (c) ohjelmiston oikeudet
vastaanottava osapuoli hyväksyy tämän sopimuksen ehdot sekä mahdolliset muut ehdot, joiden
sitomana käyttäjä on hankkinut ohjelmiston voimassa olevan käyttöoikeuden. Lisätietoa
määrälisenssiohjelmiston siirto-oikeuksista on saatavissa osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_fi.
4.6.3 Mikäli ohjelmisto vaatii säännöllistä aktivointia tai rekisteröintiä ja Adobe myöntyy käyttäjän
pyyntöön vapauttaa tämä säännöllisestä aktivointi- tai rekisteröintivaatimuksesta, tällöin
aktivointiehdoissa (kuten ne kohdassa 14.3 määritellään) esitettyjen rajoitusten lisäksi oikeus pysyvään
siirtoon, kuten kohdassa 4.6.2 ilmoitetaan, loppuu välittömästi Adoben myönnyttyä kyseiseen
pyyntöön.
4.7 Palvelukeskuskielto. Käyttäjä ei saa käyttää tai tarjota ohjelmistoa palveluskeskuspohjalta.
Kohdassa 16.6.3 on myönnetty rajoitettu poikkeus ainoastaan fonttiohjelmistolle.
4.8 Adobe Runtimea koskevat rajoitukset. Käyttäjä ei saa käyttää Adobe Runtime -ohjelmia missään
laitteessa, mikä ei ole PC, eikä käyttää Adobe Runtimea minkään laiteversio- tai sisäänrakennetun
käyttöjärjestelmän kanssa. Epäselvyyksien välttämiseksi käyttäjä ei voi käyttää Adobe Runtimea
esimerkiksi (a) mobiililaitteissa, tv-sovittimissa, kämmentietokoneissa, puhelimissa, pelikonsoleissa,
televisioissa, DVD-soittimissa, mediakeskuksissa (muut kuin Windows XP Media Center Edition ja sen
seuraajat), sähköisissä ilmoitustauluissa tai muissa digitaalisissa ilmoituslaitteissa, verkkolaitteissa
(Internet appliance) tai muissa Internetiin kytketyissä laitteissa, kämmenmikroissa, terveydenhuollon
laitteissa, pankkiautomaateissa, telemaattisissa laitteissa, pelikoneissa, kotiautomaatiojärjestelmissä,
kioskeissa, kaukosäädinlaitteissa tai missä tahansa muussa kuluttajaelektroniikkalaitteessa,
(b) operaattoripohjaisissa mobiili-, kaapeli- satelliitti- tai televisiojärjestelmissä tai (c) muissa suljetun
järjestelmän laitteissa. Lisätietoja Adobe Runtimesin lisensoinnista on osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_fi.
4.9 Alue. Asiakas saa käyttää ohjelmistoa ja Adobe Online -palveluita sillä alueella ja sillä tavalla kuin
osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fi kuvatussa aktivointikäytännössä kuvataan. Adobe
voi lakkauttaa tässä myönnetyn käyttöoikeuden tai keskeyttää jäsenyyden tai Adobe Online -
palveluiden käytön, jos Adobe päättää, että asiakas käyttää ohjelmistoa tai Adobe Online -palveluita
alueen ulkopuolella.
5. Päivitykset.
Mikäli ohjelmisto on Adobe-ohjelmiston edeltävän version päivitys (”edeltävä versio”), käyttäjän oikeus
päivityksen käyttöön riippuu ohjelmiston edeltävän version säilyttämisestä. Jos käyttäjä siis siirtää tämän
päivityksen laillisesti kohdan 4.6 mukaisesti, sen mukana pitää siirtää edeltävä versio. Jos käyttäjä
haluaa käyttää edeltävän version lisäksi tätä päivitystä, se on luvallista vain samalla tietokoneella, johon
edeltävä versio on asennettu ja jossa sitä käytetään. Kaikki Adoben mahdolliset velvoitteet, jotka
liittyvät edeltävien versioiden tukemiseen käyttöoikeuden voimassaoloaikana, saattavat loppua, kun
tämä päivitys on saatavilla. Päivityksen muu käyttö ei ole sallittua. Adobe saattaa myöntää käyttäjälle
lisäpäivitysten käyttöoikeudet lisäehdoilla tai muilla ehdoilla.
--- Page 134 ---
6. Rajoitettu takuu.
Mikäli muuta ei ilmoiteta erillisessä, Adoben ja ohjelmiston käyttöoikeudenhaltijan solmimassa
sopimuksessa, Adobe takaa sille yksittäiselle käyttäjälle tai oikeushenkilölle, joka ensimmäisenä hankkii
käyttöoikeuden ohjelmistoon tämän sopimuksen mukaista käyttöä varten, että ohjelmisto toimii
olennaisilta osiltaan ohjelmiston vastaavan käyttöohjeen mukaisesti lyhyemmän ajan, joko
(a) yhdeksänkymmenen (90) päivän ajan tai (b) käyttöoikeuden voimassaoloajan ohjelmiston
vastaanottamisesta (”takuuaika”), kun ohjelmistoa käytetään yhteensopivassa tietokoneessa. Toiminnan
epäoleelliset poikkeamat käyttöohjeesta eivät muodosta oikeutta takuuseen. Rajoitettua takuuta ei
sovelleta seuraaviin, jotka Adobe toimittaa SELLAISINAAN ja ilman Adoben takuuta:
(i) paikkaukset,(ii) fonttiohjelmistot; (iii) ennakkojulkaisuohjelmistot, kokeiluversiot, aloitusversiot,
arviointiversiot, näytetuotteet, arviointiohjelmistot ja ei-jälleenmyytävät ohjelmistokopiot;
(iv) verkkosivustot, Adoben online-palvelut; ja kolmansien osapuolien online-palvelut; (v) Certified
Document Service -palvelut (katso kohta 16); ja (vi) kaikki Adoben verkkosivustoilta ilmaiseksi
ladattavissa olevat ohjelmistot. Kaikki takuuvaatimukset tulee esittää yhdessä ostotositteen kanssa
Adoben asiakastukiosastolle sanotun yhdeksänkymmenen (90) päivän kuluessa. Lisätietoja
takuuvaatimuksen esittämisestä on osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/support_fi. Adoben ja sen
konserniyhtiöiden (sanottuun takuuvaatimukseen liittyvä) vastuu kokonaisuudessaan sekä käyttäjän
ainoa ja yksinomainen oikeus vahingonkorvauksiin, minkä takuun nojalla tahansa, rajoittuvat Adoben
valinnan mukaan vaihtoehtoisesti joko ohjelmiston tukeen takuuvaatimuksen perusteella, ohjelmiston
vaihtamiseen toiseen tai, mikäli tuki tai vaihtaminen ei ole Adoben mukaan mahdollista, ohjelmistosta
mahdollisesti maksetun käyttöoikeusmaksun palauttamiseen. TÄSSÄ KOHDASSA ESITETTY
RAJOITETTU TAKUU ANTAA KÄYTTÄJÄLLE ERITYISIÄ LAILLISIA OIKEUKSIA. KÄYTTÄJÄLLÄ SAATTAA
OLLA LAIN MUKAAN MUUNLAISIA OIKEUKSIA, JOTKA VAIHTELEVAT LAINKÄYTTÖALUEITTAIN.

huolimatta riippumatta siitä, mistä syystä se on aiheutunut. Tämä ei kuitenkaan tarkoita tai luo
minkäänlaista jatkuvaa oikeutta käyttää ohjelmistoa tämän sopimuksen voimassaolon päättymisen
jälkeen.

vastuuta käyttäjää kohtaan Adoben tuottamuksesta tai vilpillisyydestä (petos) aiheutuneesta
kuolemasta tai henkilövahingosta. Adobe toimii konserniyhtiöidensä, toimittajiensa ja sertifiointitahojen
puolesta ainoastaan kiistääkseen, rajatakseen ja rajoittaakseen velvoitteita, takuita ja vastuita, ei muussa
suhteessa tai tarkoituksessa.

KOHDASSA 16.
9. Vientisäännökset.
Käyttäjä hyväksyy, että ohjelmistoa koskevat Yhdysvaltain vientiä koskevat lait (""EAR""), ja että hänen on
noudatettava EAR:ia. Käyttäjä ei vie tai jälleenvie ohjelmistoa suoraan tai välillisesti: a) mihinkään
Yhdysvaltain vientirajoituksien alaiseen maahan (luettelossa ovat muun muassa Kuuba, Iran, Pohjois-
Korea, Sudan ja Syyria), (b) kenellekään loppukäyttäjälle, jonka asiakas tietää tai josta asiakkaalla on
syytä tietää tämän käyttävän ohjelmistoa ydinaseiden, kemiallisten aseiden tai biologisten aseiden tai
rakettijärjestelmien, avaruusrakettijärjestelmien, tutkimusrakettien tai miehittämättömien
ilmalaitejärjestelmien suunnitteluun, kehittämiseen tai tuottamiseen, tai (c) kenellekään
loppukäyttäjälle, jota jokin Yhdysvaltain liittovaltion taho on kieltänyt osallistumasta mihinkään
Yhdysvaltain vientitoimintoihin. Lisäksi käyttäjä on vastuussa paikallisen lainsäädäntöalueen niiden
lakien noudattamisesta, jotka saattavat vaikuttaa käyttäjän oikeuteen tuoda, viedä tai käyttää
ohjelmistoa. Jos Adobe on saanut tietää, että ehtoja on rikottu, Adobea voidaan estää tarjoamasta
ohjelmistolle ylläpito- ja huoltotukea.
10. Sovellettava laki.
Jos käyttäjä on kuluttaja, joka käyttää ohjelmistoa ainoastaan henkilökohtaisiin, ei-liiketoiminnallisiin
tarkoituksiin, tähän sopimukseen sovelletaan sen lainsäädäntöalueen lakeja, josta ohjelman
käyttöoikeus on hankittu. Jos käyttäjä ei ole sanottu kuluttaja, tähän sopimukseen ja sen tulkintaan
sovelletaan seuraavien maiden voimassaolevia lakeja: (a) Kalifornian osavaltio, jos ohjelmiston
käyttöoikeus on hankittu Yhdysvalloissa, Kanadassa tai Meksikossa, (b) Japani, jos ohjelmiston
käyttöoikeus on hankittu Japanissa, (c) Singapore, jos ohjelmiston käyttöoikeus on hankittu ASEAN-
jäsenvaltiossa, Kiinan kansantasavallassa, Hongkongin erityishallintoalueella, Macaon
erityishallintoalueella, Taiwanissa tai Korean tasavallassa; tai (d) Englanti ja Wales, jos ohjelmiston
käyttöoikeus on hankittu muulla kuin edellä mainituilla lainkäyttöalueilla. Vastaavasti kaikissa tähän
--- Page 136 ---
sopimukseen liittyvissä kiistoissa ei-yksinomainen tuomiovalta Kalifornian lakia sovellettaessa on Santa
Claran piirikunnan tuomioistuimella, Japanin lakia sovellettaessa Tokion aluetuomioistuimella ja
Englannin ja Walesin lakia sovellettaessa Lontoon toimivaltaisilla tuomioistuimilla. Singaporen lakia
sovellettaessa kaikki tästä sopimuksesta johtuvat tai sopimukseen liittyvät kiistat, mukaan lukien
sopimuksen olemassaolo, pätevyys tai päättäminen, siirretään välimieskäsittelyn päätettäviksi
Singaporessa SIACin (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) sillä hetkellä voimassa olevien
välimiessäännösten mukaisesti, jotka sisällytetään sopimukseen tällä viittauksella. Käytettävissä on yksi
osapuolten yhdessä valitsema välimies. Mikäli välimiestä ei valita kolmenkymmenen (30) päivän
kuluessa osapuolen kirjallisesta välimieskäsittelyn vaatimuksesta, SIACin puheenjohtaja tekee valinnan.
Välimieskäsittelyssä käytettävä kieli on englanti. Huolimatta mistään tämän sopimuksen ehdoista,
Adobe tai käyttäjä voi pyytää lainsäädännöllistä, hallinnollista tai muuta viranomaista määräämään
väliaikaisen tai voimassapitävän toimenpiteen, mukaan lukien kieltotoimet, tietyt toimet tai muut
vastaavat vasteet ennen laillisia tai välimieskäsittelytoimia tai näiden toimien aikana osapuolen
oikeuksien ja etujen säilyttämiseksi tai tiettyjen mahdollisesti korvausten alaisten ehtojen
ylläpitämiseksi. Tähän sopimukseen ei sovelleta seuraavia, jotka suljetaan tässä nimenomaisesti pois:
(x) minkään lainkäyttöalueen lainvalintaa koskevia säännöksiä, (y) yleissopimusta kansainvälistä tavaran
kauppaa koskevista sopimuksista (ns. YK:n kauppalaki) tai (z) Uniform Computer Information
Transactions Act -lakia millään lainkäyttöalueella säädetyssä muodossa.
11. Yleiset määräykset.
Mikäli ilmenee, että jokin osa tästä sopimuksesta on mitätön tai täytäntöönpanokelvoton, tämä seikka
ei vaikuta sopimuksen jäljelle jäävien osien pätevyyteen, vaan sopimus säilyy muilta osin sitovana ja
täytäntöönpanokelpoisena ehtojensa mukaisesti. Tätä sopimusta voidaan muuttaa ainoastaan
kirjallisesti edellyttäen, että Adoben siihen valtuuttama toimihenkilö allekirjoittaa muutoksen. Tämän
sopimuksen tulkinnassa käytetään sopimuksen englanninkielistä versiota. Tämä sopimus muodostaa
koko Adoben ja käyttäjän välisen ohjelmistoa koskevan sopimuksen, ja se syrjäyttää kaikki aikaisemmat
ohjelmistoa koskevat esitykset, keskustelut, sitoumukset, yhteydenpidot ja mainonnan.
12. Tiedotus Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon palveluksessa oleville loppukäyttäjille.
12.1 Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon Adobe-teknologian käyttöoikeudet. Käyttäjä suostuu siihen, että
käyttäjän hankittaessa lisenssin Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnolle tai mille tahansa sen toimeksisaajista,
käyttöoikeuden on noudatettava (siviiliviranomaisten kyseessä ollessa) säädöksessä 48 C.F.R. § 12.212
määrättyjä käytäntöjä sekä (puolustusministeriön kyseessä ollessa) säädöksessä 48 C.F.R. § 227.7202-1
ja § 227.7202-4 määrättyjä käytäntöjä. Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon palveluksessa olevien
loppukäyttäjien osalta Adobe noudattaa sovellettavissa olevia tasavertaisten mahdollisuuksien
takaamiseksi säädettyjä lakeja mukaan lukien mahdollisuuksien mukaan toimeenpanomääräystä
(Executive Order) 11246 muutoksineen, Vietnamin sodan veteraanien sopeuttamisen avustamisesta
vuonna 1974 annetun lain (38 USC 4212) §:ää 402 ja vuonna 1973 annetun kuntoutuslain §:ää 503
muutoksineen sekä säännöksen 41 CFR osia 601 - 6060, 60250 ja 60741. Viittauksella sisällytetään
tähän sopimukseen tasavertaisuuslaki (Affirmative Action Clause) ja edeltävän lauseen sisältämät
säännökset.
12.2 Kauppatavarat. Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon palveluksessa olevien loppukäyttäjien osalta
ohjelmisto on kauppatavaraa (Commercial Item), kuten termi on määritelty kappaleen 48 C.F.R.
§:ssä 2.101. Nämä kauppatavarat koostuvat kappaleissa 48 C.F.R. (§ 12.212) ja 48 C.F.R. (§ 227.7202)
käytettyjen soveltuvien termien mukaisista kaupallisista tietokoneohjelmistoista (Commercial Computer
Software) ja kaupallisen tietokoneohjelmiston dokumentaatiosta (Commercial Computer Software
Documentation). Soveltuvasti kappaleiden 48 C.F.R. (§ 12.212) ja 48 C.F.R., (§ 227.7202-1 – 227.7202-4)
mukaisesti kaupalliseen tietokoneohjelmistoon ja kaupallisen tietokoneohjelmiston dokumentaatioon
myönnetään käyttöoikeus Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon palveluksessa oleville loppukäyttäjille (a) vain
kauppatavaroina (Commercial Items) ja (b) vain niillä oikeuksilla, jotka on myönnetty kaikille muille
--- Page 137 ---
loppukäyttäjille tässä mainittujen ehtojen mukaisesti. Julkaisemattoman materiaalin oikeudet
pidätetään Yhdysvaltain tekijänoikeuslakien mukaisesti.
13. Käyttöoikeuksien noudattaminen.
Jos käyttäjänä on liikeyritys, yhtiö tai organisaatio, käyttäjä sitoutuu siihen, että ohjelmiston
mahdollisesti suorittamien käyttöoikeusvahvistuksien lisäksi Adobella tai sen valtuutetulla edustajalla
on oikeus tarkastaa seitsemän (7) päivän ennakkoilmoituksella, ei kuitenkaan useammin kuin
kahdentoista (12) kuukauden välein, käyttäjän tallenteet, järjestelmät ja tilat varmistaakseen, että
Adoben kaikkien ohjelmistojen ja palvelujen käyttö on Adoben käyttäjälle myöntämän, voimassaolevan
käyttöoikeussopimuksen mukaista. Adobella on esimerkiksi oikeus käyttäjän niihin tallenteisiin, joiden
avulla voidaan määrittää, onko ohjelmiston asennukset sarjanumeroitu, ja käyttäjän on annettava
kyseiset tallenteet Adobelle viipymättä Adoben niitä pyytäessä. Lisäksi käyttäjä antaa Adobelle kaikki
Adoben pyytämät tallenteet ja tiedot kolmenkymmenen (30) päivän kuluessa Adoben pyynnöstä, jolla
varmistetaan, että käyttäjän Adobe-ohjelmistojen käyttö on voimassa olevien käyttöoikeuksien
mukaista. Lisätietoja sarjanumeroinnista on osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_fi.
14. Internet-yhteys ja tietosuoja.
14.1 Automaattinen Internet-yhteyden luonti. Ohjelmisto voi yhdistää tietokoneen automaattisesti ja
ilman erillistä ilmoitusta Internetiin ja Adoben verkkosivustoon tai toimialueeseen. Tarkoituksena voi
olla esimerkiksi käyttöoikeuden vahvistaminen tai lisätietojen ja uusien ominaisuuksien sekä
toimintojen välittäminen käyttäjälle. Ellei kohdissa 14.2–14.7 toisin mainita, seuraavat määräykset
koskevat kaikkia ohjelmiston luomia automaattisia Internet-yhteyksiä:
14.1.1 Ohjelmiston muodostaessa yhteyden Internetiin ja kommunikoidessa Adoben verkkosivuston
kanssa, joko automaattisesti tai käyttäjän pyynnöstä, noudatetaan tietosuojakäytäntöä. Adoben
tietosuojakäytäntö mahdollistaa verkkosivustoilla käyntien seurannan. Lisäksi siinä on kuvattu
yksityiskohtaisesti evästeiden, jäljitteiden ja vastaavien sovellusten seuranta ja käyttö.
14.1.2 Kun ohjelmisto muodostaa Internetin kautta yhteyden Adobeen, ohjelmisto kerää ja välittää
Adobelle joitakin käyttäjää koskevia tietoja noudattaen Adoben online-tietosuojalausuntoa, joka löytyy
osoitteesta http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fi (”Yksityisyyttä koskeva toimintaohjelma”).
14.1.3 Jos käyttäjä kirjautuu Adoben online-palveluun (määritelty alla kohdassa 16.4) tai aktivoi tai
rekisteröi ohjelmiston, tietyt lisätiedot, kuten käyttäjän Adoben käyttäjätunnus, käyttäjänimi ja salasana
voidaan lähettää Adobelle ja Adobe saattaa tallentaa ne tietosuojakäytäntöä noudattaen ja tällaista
Adoben online-palvelua koskevien muiden käyttöehtojen mukaisesti (yleisemmin Adobe.comin
käyttöehtojen ja sovellettavissa olevien ehtojen kanssa ”lisäkäyttöehdot”).
14.1.4 Kuten soveltuva laki sallii, tai käyttäjän suostumuksen nojalla, Adobe voi (a) lähettää käyttäjälle
tapahtumaviestejä edistääkseen Adoben online-palvelua tai ohjelmiston tai Adoben online-palvelun
aktivointia tai rekisteriöintiä, tai (b) suorittaa tuotteensisäistä markkinointia jakaakseen tietoa
ohjelmistosta ja muista Adoben tuotteista ja palveluista käyttämällä tietoja, mukaan lukien (mutta ei
niihin rajoittuen) ohjelmistoalustan versiota, ohjelmistoversiota, käyttöoikeuden tilaa ja kielitietoja.
14.2 Päivitykset. Ohjelmisto saattaa kytkeä käyttäjän tietokoneen automaattisesti Internetiin ilman
erillistä ilmoitusta (ajoittain tai säännöllisesti) (a) koneelle ladattavien ja asennettavien päivitysten
tarkistamiseksi ja (b) ilmoittaakseen Adobelle asennusyritysten tulokset.
14.3 Aktivointi. Ohjelmisto voi vaatia käyttäjää (a) hankkimaan Adoben käyttäjätunnuksen,
(b) aktivoimaan ohjelmiston tai aktivoimaan sen uudelleen, (c) rekisteröimään ohjelmiston tai
(d) vahvistamaan jäsenyyden. Tämän vaatimuksen johdosta käyttäjän tietokone voi kytkeytyä
automaattisesti Internetiin ilman erillistä ilmoitusta asennuksen tai käynnistyksen yhteydessä ja
säännölllisesti tämän jälkeen. Yhteyden muodostamisen jälkeen ohjelmisto kerää tietoja ja lähettää ne
Adobelle osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fi kuvatulla tavalla (”aktivointiehdot”).
--- Page 138 ---
Ohjelmisto tai käyttäjä voi myös vastaanottaa Adobelta tietoja, jotka liittyvät käyttäjän käyttöoikeuteen,
tilaukseen tai jäsenyyteen. Adobe voi käyttää näitä tietoja havaitakseen tai estääkseen voimassa olevan
käyttöoikeussopimuksen, tilauksen tai jäsenyyden vastaisen vilpillisen tai valtuuttamattoman käytön.
Mikäli ohjelmistoa ei aktivoida tai rekisteröidä, tilausta tai jäsenyyttä ei vahvisteta tai Adobe huomaa
ohjelmistoa käytettävän vilpillisesti tai ilman valtuuksia, seurauksena voi olla ohjelmiston joidenkin
toimintojen estyminen, ohjelmiston toiminnan loppuminen tai jäsenyyden tai tilauksen keskeyttäminen
tai lopettaminen.
14.4 Käytöstä poistaminen. Käyttäjä voi poistaa ohjelmiston käytön ja poistaa asennuksen
tietokoneestaan asentaakseen ja ottaakseen ohjelmiston käyttöön toisessa tietokoneessa tämän
sopimuksen mukaisesti (”käytöstä poistaminen”), kuten osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fi kuvataan. Käytöstä poistaminen vaatii Internet-yhteyden
muodostamista.
14.5 Online-palveluiden käyttäminen. Ohjelmisto saattaa kytkeä käyttäjän tietokoneen automaattisesti
Internetiin ilman erillistä ilmoitusta joko ajoittain tai säännöllisesti Adoben tai kolmansien osapuolien
tarjoaman sisällön ja palveluiden saannin helpottamiseksi kohdassa 16.4 (online-palvelut) kuvatulla
tavalla. Ohjelmisto voi lisäksi muodostaa yhteyden Internetiin automaattisesti ilman erillistä ilmoitusta
ladattavien materiaalien päivittämiseksi kyseisistä online-palveluista heti niiden ilmestyttyä jopa silloin,
kun Internet-yhteyttä ei ole muodostettu.
14.6 Digitaaliset sertifikaatit. Ohjelmisto käyttää digitaalisia sertifikaatteja (kuten kohdassa 16.5 on
kuvattu), joiden avulla käyttäjä voi tunnistaa ladatut tiedostot (esimerkiksi sovellukset ja sisältö) sekä
tiedostojen julkaisijat. Esimerkiksi Adobe AIR käyttää digitaalisia sertifikaatteja auttaakseen käyttäjää
tunnistamaan Adobe AIR -sovellusten julkaisijan. Adobe Acrobat -tuoteperhe myös käyttää digitaalisia
sertifikaatteja PDF-asiakirjojen (Portable Document Format-tiedostojen) allekirjoittamiseksi ja niiden
sisältämien allekirjoitusten varmentamiseksi sekä sertifioitujen PDF-asiakirjojen varmentamiseksi.
Käyttäjän tietokone voi luoda yhteyden Internetiin digitaalisen sertifikaatin varmentamisen aikana.
14.7 Asetustenhallintaohjelma. Ohjelmisto voi sisältää Flash Playerin. Flash Player saattaa tallentaa
jotkut käyttäjäasetukset käyttäjän tietokoneeseen paikallisesti jaettuina. Ne liittyvät käyttäjän
tietokoneeseen asennettuun Flash Playerin versioon, jolla käyttäjä voi mukauttaa suorituksenaikaisia
ominaisuuksia. Käyttäjä voi muokata näitä asetuksia Flash Playerin asetustenhallintaohjelmalla.
Käyttäjällä on myös mahdollisuus rajoittaa kolmansien osapuolien oikeutta tallentaa paikallisesti
jaettuja kohteita tai myöntää kolmannen osapuolen sisällölle oikeuden käyttää tietokoneen mikrofonia
ja kameraa. Lisätietoja käyttäjän Flash Playerin version asetusten määrittämisestä ja siitä, miten
kohteiden paikallinen jakaminen poistetaan käytöstä Flash Playerin asetustenhallintaohjelmalla, on
osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_fi. Lisätietoja kohteiden paikallisesta
jakamisesta on osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_fi.
15. Vertaiskommunikaatio.
Ohjelmisto voi hyödyntää käyttäjän yhteyttä paikallisverkkoon ja muodostaa ilman erillistä ilmoitusta
automaattisesti yhteyden muihin Adoben ohjelmistoihin ilmaisten samalla olevansa käytettävissä
tiedonsiirtoon kyseisten ohjelmistojen kanssa. Nämä yhteydet voivat lähettää käyttäjän IP-osoitteen
paikallisverkkoon.
16. Erityisehdot ja poikkeukset.
Tässä kohdassa on määritelty tiettyjä ohjelmiston komponentteja ja tuotteita koskevia erityisehtoja sekä
rajoitettuja poikkeuksia edellä määriteltyihin ehtoihin ja määräyksiin. Mikäli mikä tahansa tässä
kohdassa määritelty ehto on ristiriidassa muiden tämän sopimuksen ehtojen tai määräysten kanssa,
tämä kohta syrjäyttää sellaisen toisen ehdon tai määräyksen.
--- Page 139 ---
16.1 Oikeuksien rajoittamattomuus, Euroopan talousalueen ehdot, pakollinen australialainen ilmoitus.
16.1.1 Tämä sopimus ei rajoita minkään osapuolen lakiin perustuvia oikeuksia, kuluttajat mukaan
lukien. Esimerkiksi sellaisten Uudessa-Seelannissa asuvien kuluttajien osalta, jotka ovat hankkineet
ohjelmiston henkilökohtaiseen, koti- tai kotitalouskäyttöön (ei yrityskäyttöön), tähän sopimukseen
sovelletaan Consumer Guarantees Act -lakia.
16.1.2 Mikäli käyttäjä on hankkinut ohjelmiston Euroopan talousalueen (ETAn) alueella, ETA on hänen
tavanmukainen asuinpaikkansa ja käyttäjä on kuluttaja (eli hän käyttää ohjelmistoa henkilökohtaiseen
käyttöön, ei liiketoimintatarkoituksiin), ohjelmiston hankintaan ja käyttöön ei sovelleta kohtaa 6
(”Rajoitettu takuu”). Sen sijaan Adobe takaa, että ohjelmisto tarjoaa soveltuvassa käyttöohjeessa kuvatut
toiminnot (”sovitut toiminnot”) kahden vuoden ajan ostosta, kun sitä käytetään yhteensopivassa
tietokoneessa. Epäoleelliset poikkeamat sovituista toiminnoista eivät muodosta oikeutta takuuseen.
TÄTÄ TAKUUTA EI SOVELLETA OHJELMISTOON, JOTA KÄYTETÄÄN ENNAKKOJULKAISUNA,
KOKEILUVERSIONA, ALOITUSVERSIONA TAI NÄYTETUOTTEENA, TAI FONTTIOHJELMISTOON TAI JOS
OHJELMISTON ONGELMAT JOHTUVAT KÄYTTÄJÄN OHJELMISTOON TEKEMISTÄ MUUTOKSISTA.
Takuuvaatimus on esitettävä Adoben asiakastukiosastolle näiden kahden vuoden aikana, ja samalla on
esitettävä ohjelmiston ostotosite. Adobe tarkistaa käyttäjän kanssa, onko virhe ohjelmistossa, tai
ilmoittaa käyttäjälle, että virhe johtuu siitä, että ohjelmistoa ei ole asennettu oikein (tässä tapauksessa
Adobe avustaa käyttäjää). Jos ohjelmistossa on virhe, käyttäjä voi pyytää Adobelta joko hyvitystä tai
ohjelmiston kopion korjaamista/vaihtamista. Pyyntöihin on liitettävä ostotosite. Mikäli käyttäjän oikeus
takuuseen vahvistetaan, Adobe vastaa pyyntöön korjaamalla/vaihtamalla ohjelmiston, tai jos tämä ei
ole Adoben kannalta kohtuullista, Adobe tarjoaa käyttäjälle hyvityksen. Lisätietoja takuusta saa
ottamalla yhteyttä Adoben asiakastukiosastoon.
Huomaa, että kohdan 8 (”Vastuunrajoitus”) ehdot ovat voimassa kaikissa käyttäjän tekemissä,
ohjelmiston käyttöön liittyvissä vahingonkorvausvaatimuksissa. Adobe on kuitenkin velvollinen
korvaamaan suorat, kohtuudella ennakoitavissa olevat menetykset, jos Adobe rikkoo tätä sopimusta.
Suosittelemme käyttäjää ryhtymään kaikkiin kohtuullisiin toimenpiteisiin välttääkseen ja vähentääkseen
vahinkojen syntymistä, erityisesti ottamalla ohjelmistosta tai tietokoneen tiedoista varmuuskopiot.
Tässä sopimuksessa ja etenkin tässä kohdassa 16.1.2 kuvataan käyttäjän oikeudet (lakiin perustuvat
oikeudet mukaan lukien) siltä varalta, että ohjelmiston käytössä ilmenee ongelmia. Jos käyttäjän lakiin
perustuvat oikeudet ovat laajemmat kuin tässä kuvatut, sovelletaan lakiin perustuvia oikeuksia.
16.1.3 Mikään tässä sopimuksessa mainittu (mukaan lukien kohta 4.4) ei rajoita sovellettavassa laissa
mahdollisesti määrättyjä, käyttäjän luovuttamattomia oikeuksia ohjelmiston purkamiseen. Esimerkiksi
Euroopan unioniin (EU) kuuluvalla käyttäjällä saattaa olla sovellettavassa laissa määritellyissä tietyissä
tilanteissa oikeus purkaa ohjelmisto, jos se on välttämätöntä ohjelman toiminnan sovittamiseksi toisen
sovellusohjelman kanssa käytettäväksi ja käyttäjä on ensin kirjallisesti pyytänyt Adobelta tähän
tarvittavia tietoja, joita Adobe ei ole toimittanut. Tämän lisäksi tällaisen purkamisen saa suorittaa
ainoastaan käyttäjä tai käyttäjän puolesta ohjelmiston kopion käyttöön oikeutettu henkilö. Adobella on
oikeus määrätä kohtuullisia ehtoja ennen kyseisten tietojen toimittamista. Käyttäjä saa käyttää Adoben
toimittamia tai käyttäjän hankkimia tietoja vain tässä sallitulla tavalla tässä kuvattuun tarkoitukseen,
eikä tietoja saa paljastaa kolmansille osapuolille tai käyttää ohjelmiston ilmettä olennaisesti vastaavan
ohjelmiston luomiseen tai käyttää tavalla, joka loukkaa Adoben tai sen lisensoijien tekijänoikeuksia.
16.1.4 Jos asiakas hankkii ohjelmiston Australiasta, seuraavat ehdot ovat voimassa, riippumatta tämän
sopimuksen muista kohdista:
ILMOITUS AUSTRALIALAISILLE KULUTTAJILLE:
Tuotteisiimme sisältyy takuu, jota ei voi jättää pois Australian kuluttajansuojalain mukaan. Sinulla on
oikeus saada uusi versio tai takaisinmaksu suurten vikojen tapauksessa sekä korvaus kohtuullisesti
ennakoitavasta menetyksestä tai vahingosta. Sinulla on myös oikeus saada tuotteet korjattua tai
vaihdettua, jos tuotteet eivät ole hyväksyttävää laatua ja vika ei ole suuri vika. Ohjelmistotuotteisiimme
sisältyy 90 päivän rajoitettu takuu, jonka myöntää Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, jonka
--- Page 140 ---
toimisto on osoitteessa 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland, kuten
sopimuksessa ilmoitetaan. Jos tuotteet eivät tarjoa käyttäjäasiakirjoissa kuvattuja yleisiä ominaisuuksia
ja toimintoja 90 päivän sisällä tuotteiden toimittamisesta sinulle, soita Adoben asiakastukeen numeroon
1800 614 863 ja kerro tuotteesi tiedot, sarjanumero ja ostokuitin tiedot. Sinua voidaan pyytää
palauttamaan ohjelmistotuote antamaamme osoitteeseen, jolloin palautuskulut lankeavat sinulle.
Tämän takuun myöntämät edut ovat muiden lain mukaisten oikeuksien ja korjauskeinojen lisänä.
16.2 Ennakkojulkaisuohjelmistoa koskevat lisäehdot. Mikäli ohjelmisto on ennakkojulkaisu tai beeta-
versio (”ennakkojulkaisuohjelmisto”), sovelletaan tätä kohtaa. Ennakkojulkaisuohjelmisto ei vastaa
Adoben lopullista tuotetta. Se voi sisältää vikoja, virheitä ja muita ongelmia, jotka voivat aiheuttaa
järjestelmäongelmia sekä tietojen häviämistä. Adobe ei välttämättä koskaan julkaise tai muuten saata
ennakkojulkaisuohjelmistoa kaupalliseen jakeluun. Mikäli käyttäjä on vastaanottanut
ennakkojulkaisuohjelmiston erillisen kirjallisen sopimuksen mukaisesti, kuten Adobe Systems
Incorporatedin ennakkojulkaisuohjelmiston käyttöoikeussopimuksen mukaisesti, sopimus koskee myös
ohjelmiston käyttöä. Käyttäjä sitoutuu välittömästi palauttamaan tai tuhoamaan kaikki kopiot
ennakkojulkaisuohjelmistosta Adoben pyynnöstä tai Adoben julkaistessa ohjelmiston kaupalliseen
levitykseen. KÄYTTÄJÄ KÄYTTÄÄ ENNAKKOJULKAISUOHJELMISTOA OMALLA VASTUULLAAN.
ENNAKKOJULKAISUOHJELMISTOIHIN LIITTYVÄT VASTUUNRAJOITUKSET SEKÄ RAJOITETTU TAKUU
ON MÄÄRITELTY KOHDISSA 6 JA 8.
16.3 Opetuskäyttöön tarkoitettu ohjelmistotuote. Mikäli ohjelmisto on opetuskäyttöön tarkoitettu
ohjelmistotuote (vain koulutusalaan liittyvän loppukäyttäjän käyttöön valmistettu ja jaettu ohjelmisto),
käyttäjä ei ole oikeutettu käyttämään ohjelmistoa, ellei häntä omalla lainkäyttöalueellaan voida
määrittää koulutusalaan liittyväksi loppukäyttäjäksi. Tietoja tällaiseen käyttöön oikeuttavasta
kelpoisuudesta löytyy sivulta http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_fi. Adoben valtuutttamat
koulutustuotteiden jälleenmyyjät löytyvät http://www.adobe.com/go/store_fi -sivustolla olevasta
Buying Adobe Products Worldwide -linkistä.
16.4 Online-palvelut.
16.4.1 Adoben tarjoamat palvelut. Ohjelmisto helpottaa käyttäjän pääsyä Adoben tai sen
konserniyhtiöiden ylläpitämillä verkkosivustoilla olevaan sisältö- ja palvelutarjontaan (Adoben online-
palvelut). Adoben online-palveluja ovat muun muassa: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business
Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help, ja tuote Welcome Screens. Adoben
online-palvelu voi joissakin tapauksissa vaikuttaa ohjelmiston toiminnolta tai laajennukselta, vaikka se
sijaitseekin verkkosivustolla. Adoben online-palvelun käyttäminen voi vaatia, että käyttäjä aktivoi
ohjelmiston, hankkii Adoben käyttäjätunnuksen, hyväksyy käyttöä koskevat lisäehdot tai suorittaa
erillisen maksun Adoben kyseisen online-palvelun käyttämisestä. Adoben online-palveluja ei ole
välttämättä saatavissa kaikilla kielillä ja kaikissa maissa ja Adobe voi milloin tahansa oman harkintansa
mukaan muuttaa tai keskeyttää minkä tahansa online-palvelun saatavuuden. Adobe pidättää itsellään
myös oikeuden veloittaa tulevaisuudessa maksuja aiemmin ilmaiseksi tarjotuista Adoben online-
palveluista. Kohdassa 14 on tärkeitä tietoja Internet-yhteyksien muodostamisesta ja käyttäjän
tietosuojasta. Kuten kohdassa 14 todetaan, kun ohjelmisto luo yhteyden Adoben online-palveluun,
kyseisen Adoben online-palvelun käyttöön sovelletaan Adoben online-tietosuojalausuntoa
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fi), Adobe.comin käyttöehtoja
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_fi), ja käyttäjälle käyttöhetkellä mahdollisesti esitettyjä
lisäkäyttöehtoja.
16.4.2 Kolmansien osapuolien tarjoamat palvelut. Ohjelmisto voi helpottaa käyttäjän pääsyä
kolmansien osapuolien ylläpitämiin verkkosivustoihin, joilla tarjotaan tuotteita, informaatiota,
ohjelmistoa ja palveluja (”kolmansien osapuolien online-palvelut”). Kolmansien osapuolien online-
palveluja ovat muun muassa Kodak EasyShare Gallery -palvelu. Käyttäjän oikeuteen käyttää kolmansien
osapuolien online-palveluja sovelletaan niitä ehtoja, vastuuvapauslausekkeita ja ilmoituksia, jotka
kyseisillä sivuilla on esitetty tai jotka muulla tavoin liittyvät kyseisiin kolmansien osapuolien online-
palveluihin. Adobe ei valvo tai tue kolmansien osapuolien tarjoamia online-palveluja eikä hyväksy
vastuuta niistä. Kaikki käyttäjän ja kolmannen osapuolen välillä olevat, kolmannen osapuolen online-
--- Page 141 ---
palveluja koskevat sopimukset, mukaan lukien kyseisen osapuolen tietosuojakäytännöt ja käyttäjän
henkilötietojen käyttöä koskevat sopimukset, tavaroiden ja palvelujen toimittamista ja maksua koskevat
sopimukset sekä kaikki muut tällaisiin sopimuksiin liittyvät ehdot, takuut ja vakuutukset koskevat
yksinomaan käyttäjää ja kyseistä kolmatta osapuolta. Kolmansien osapuolien online-palveluja ei
välttämättä ole saatavissa kaikilla kielillä ja kaikissa maissa ja Adobe voi milloin tahansa oman
harkintansa mukaan muuttaa tai poistaa minkä tahansa kolmannen osapuolen online-palvelun
saatavuuden.
16.4.3 KÄYTTÄJÄ KÄYTTÄÄ ADOBEN ONLINE-PALVELUJA JA KOLMANSIEN OSAPUOLIEN ONLINE-
PALVELUJA OMALLA VASTUULLAAN, ELLEI SIITÄ OLE NIMENOMAISESTI SOVITTU TOISIN ADOBEN,
ADOBEN KONSERNIYHTIÖIDEN TAI KOLMANNEN OSAPUOLEN KANSSA TEHTÄVÄLLÄ ERILLISELLÄ
SOPIMUKSELLA. NÄIDEN PALVELUJEN KÄYTTÖÖN SOVELLETAAN KOHTIEN 7 JA 8 TAKUU- JA
VASTUUNRAJOITUSEHTOJA.
16.5 Digitaaliset sertifikaatit.
16.5.1 Käyttö. Digitaalisia sertifikaatteja myöntävät kolmannen osapuolen sertifiointitahot, mukaan
lukien Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) -myyjät, jotka on lueteltu osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_fi, ja Adobe Approved Trust List -myyjät (”AATL”), jotka on
lueteltu osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_fi, (yleisemmin ”sertifiointitahot”). Digitaaliset
sertifikaatit voivat myös olla itse allekirjoitettuja.
16.5.2 Ehdot. Käyttäjä ja sertifiointitaho ovat vastuussa digitaalisten sertifikaattien hankinnasta, käytöstä
ja niihin luottamisesta. Ennen kuin käyttäjä luottaa mihinkään sertifioituun dokumenttiin, digitaaliseen
allekirjoitukseen tai sertifiointitahon palveluun, käyttäjän tulee lukea sertifiointitahon palveluihin
sovellettavat toimitusehdot, mukaan lukien esimerkiksi tilaajasopimukset, luotettujen osapuolten
sopimukset, sertifikaattikäytännöt ja käytäntöä koskevat ilmoitukset. Lisätietoja Adoben CDS-myyjistä
on osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_fi. Lisätietoja AATL-myyjistä on osoitteessa
http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_fi.
16.5.3 Hyväksyminen. Käyttäjä hyväksyy, että (a) ohjelmisto saattaa määrityssyistä tai ulkoisista syistä
näyttää voimassa olevan allekirjoituksen, vaikka digitaalinen sertifikaatti on saatettu peruuttaa tai se on
saattanut raueta ennen varmennusta, (b) digitaalisen sertifikaatin turvallisuus tai eheys on voinut
vaarantua dokumentin allekirjoittajan, vastaavan sertifiointitahon tai muun kolmannen osapuolen
toimenpiteestä tai laiminlyönnistä, ja (c) sertifikaatti voi olla itse allekirjoitettu, eikä sertifiointitahon
toimittama. KÄYTTÄJÄ ON YKSIN VASTUUSSA SERTIFIKAATTIIN LUOTTAMISESTA. ELLEI
SERTIFIOINTITAHO OLE ANTANUT KÄYTTÄJÄLLE ERILLISTÄ KIRJALLISTA TAKUUTA, DIGITAALISEN
SERTIFIKAATIN KÄYTTÖ ON YKSINOMAAN KÄYTTÄJÄN VASTUULLA.
16.5.4 Kolmantena osapuolena olevat edunsaajat. Käyttäjä hyväksyy, että mikä tahansa sertifiointitaho,
johon käyttäjä luottaa, on kolmantena osapuolena tässä sopimuksessa, ja että sillä on oikeus omissa
nimissään vaatia ehtojen täytäntöönpanoa samoin kuin Adobella olisi oikeus vaatia sitä.
16.5.5 Vahingonkorvaus. Käyttäjä hyväksyy, ettei Adobe tai mikään soveltuva sertifiointitaho (ellei sen
ehdoissa nimenomaisesti muuta todeta) ole vastuussa mistään vastuuvelvollisuuksista, menetyksistä,
toimista, vahingoista tai vaatimuksista (mukaan lukien kaikki kohtuulliset kustannukset, kulut ja
lakimiehen palkkiot), jotka aiheutuvat tai liittyvät asianomaisen tahon palvelujen käyttöön tai siihen
luottamiseen, mukaan lukien rajoituksetta: (a) luottaminen päättyneeseen tai peruutettuun
sertifikaattiin, (b) sertifikaatin riittämätön varmennus, (c) muun kuin soveltuvien ehtojen, tämän
sopimuksen tai soveltuvan lainsäädännön mukaisen sertifikaatin käyttäminen, (d) kohtuullisen
harkinnan laiminlyöminen julkaisijan palveluihin tai sertifikaatteihin luotettaessa tai (e) palveluita
koskevissa ehdoissa määritettyjen velvoitteiden laiminlyönti.
16.6 Fonttiohjelmisto. Mikäli ohjelmisto sisältää fonttiohjelmiston:
16.6.1 Käyttäjä voi käyttää fonttiohjelmistoa tietokoneissa yhdessä ohjelmiston kanssa kohdassa 2
kuvatulla tavalla ja tulostaa fonttiohjelmiston millä tahansa tietokoneeseen kytketyllä tulostimella.
--- Page 142 ---
16.6.2 Mikäli tietokoneiden sallittu lukumäärä on viisi (5) tai vähemmän, käyttäjä voi ladata
fonttiohjelmiston yhden vähintään yhteen tietokoneeseen kytketyn tulostimen muistiin (kiintolevy tai
RAM-muisti), jotta fonttiohjelmistoa voidaan käyttää pysyvästi tällaisessa tulostimessa, ja vielä yhden
tällaisen tulostimen muistiin jokaista viittä, sallittuun lukumäärään lukeutuvaa tietokonetta kohden.
16.6.3 Käyttäjällä on oikeus kopioida käyttäjän tiedostossa käyttämä fontti tai fontit ammattimaisessa
käytössä olevaan tulostimeen tai muun käyttäjälle palveluja tarjoavan tahon käyttöön. Käyttäjälle
palveluja tarjoavalla taholla on oikeus käyttää kirjasimia käyttäjän tiedoston käsittelemiseen, mikäli
palveluja tarjoavalla taholla on voimassa oleva käyttöoikeus käyttää kyseistä fonttiohjelmistoa.
16.6.4 Käyttäjällä on oikeus sulauttaa fonttiohjelmiston kopioita käyttäjän sähköisessä muodossa oleviin
asiakirjoihin näiden asiakirjojen tulostamista, katselua ja muokkaamista varten. Mitään muita
sulauttamisoikeuksia ei anneta tai sallita tämän käyttöoikeuden perusteella.
16.6.5 Poikkeuksena edellä mainittuun, osoitteessa http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_fi
luetellut fontit on sisällytetty ohjelmistoon ainoastaan ohjelmiston käyttöliittymän toimintatarkoituksia
varten, ei mihinkään tulostustiedostoon sisällytettäviksi. Kyseisiin lueteltuihin fontteihin ei myönnetä
käyttöoikeutta tämän sopimuksen kohdan 16.6 nojalla. Käyttäjä hyväksyy, että hän ei kopioi, siirrä,
aktivoi, käytä tai salli minkään fonttien hallintatyökalun kopioida, siirtää, aktivoida tai käyttää kyseisiä
lueteltuja fontteja mihinkään tästä ohjelmistosta poikkeavaan ohjelmistosovellukseen, ohjelmaan tai
tiedostoon, eikä hän salli fonttien käyttöä minkään tästä ohjelmistosta poikkeavan
ohjelmistosovelluksen, ohjelman tai tiedoston kanssa.
16.7 After Effects Render Engine. Mikäli ohjelmisto sisältää täyden version Adobe After
Effects -ohjelmasta, käyttäjällä on oikeus asentaa rajoittamaton määrä Render Engine -ohjelmia
tietokoneisiin käyttäjän sisäisessä tietoverkossa, joka sisältää vähintään yhden tietokoneen, johon on
asennettu Adobe After Effects -ohjelman täydellinen versio. Käsitteellä ”Render Engine” tarkoitetaan
asennettavaa toiminnallista osaa ohjelmistosta, jolla pystytään hahmontamaan After Effects -projekteja,
mutta jota ei voida käyttää projektien luomiseen tai muuttamiseen ja joka ei sisällä täydellistä After
Effects -käyttöliittymää.
16.8 Acrobat Standard-, Acrobat Pro- ja Adobe Acrobat Suite -toiminnot. Mikäli ohjelmistoon kuuluu
Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, Acrobat Suite tai joitakin niihin kuuluvia toimintoja, sovelletaan
kohtaa 16.8.
16.8.1 Lisämääritelmät.
16.8.1.1 ”Hyödyntäminen” tarkoittaa laajennetun dokumentin toimittamista suoraan tai välillisesti millä
tahansa tavalla, mukaan lukien (mutta ei niihin rajoittuen) verkon tai Internetin välityksellä, yhdelle tai
useammalle vastaanottajalle tai laajennetun dokumentin saattamista heidän saatavilleen muulla tavoin
suoraan tai välillisesti.
16.8.1.2 ”Laajennettu dokumentti” tarkoittaa ohjelmistolla käsiteltyä PDF-tiedostoa, mikä mahdollistaa
täytettyjä PDF-lomakkeita sisältävien asiakirjojen tallentamisen paikallisesti.
16.8.2 Ohjelmisto voi sisältää teknologiaa, jonka avulla käyttäjä voi aktivoida tietyillä ominaisuuksilla
varustettuja PDF-asiakirjoja käyttämällä ohjelmistoon sijoitettua sähköistä valtuutusta (”avain”). Käyttäjä
sitoutuu olemaan ottamatta yhteyttä ja yrittämättä yhteydenottoa ja olemaan valvomatta, tekemättä
toimintakyvyttömäksi, poistamatta, käyttämättä tai jakelematta avainta mihinkään tarkoitukseen.
16.8.3 Minkä tahansa laajennetun dokumentin osalta käyttäjä saa ainoastaan joko (a) hyödyntää
kyseistä laajennettua dokumenttia osoittamalla sen rajoittamattomalle määrälle yksittäisiä
vastaanottajia, mutta hän ei saa kerätä tietoja tai aiheuttaa niiden keräämistä enempää kuin kyseisen,
täytettyjä lomakekenttiä sisältävän laajennetun dokumentin tai sen mahdollisen paperikopion
viidensadan (500) yksittäisen otoksen verran, tai (b) hyödyntää kyseistä laajennettua dokumenttia
osoittamalla sen enintään viidellesadalle (500) yksittäiselle vastaanottajalle rajoittamatta niiden
kertojen lukumäärää, jolloin käyttäjä saa kerätä tietoja kyseisestä laajennetusta dokumentista, jonka
kyseinen vastaanottaja on palauttanut täytettynä käyttäjälle. Huolimatta siitä, mitä muuta tässä
--- Page 143 ---
sopimuksessa on mahdollisesti todettu, lisäkäyttöoikeuksien hankkiminen Acrobat Standard-, Acrobat
Pro- tai Adobe Acrobat Suite -ohjelman käyttämiseksi ei lisää edellä mainittuja rajoituksia (eli edellä
mainitut rajoitukset muodostavat kaikki rajoitukset kokonaisuudessaan riippumatta siitä, kuinka monta
lisäkäyttöoikeutta käyttäjä on mahdollisesti hankkinut Acrobat Standard-, Acrobat Pro- tai Adobe
Acrobat Suite -ohjelman käyttämiseksi).
16.9 Flash Player -projektorit ja Runtime. Käyttäjän oikeuteen käyttää kaikkia ohjelmiston osana tai sen
mukana toimitettuja tai tulostustiedostossa olevia Flash-toistimia, projektoreja, itsenäisiä toistimia,
laajennuksia tai ajoympäristöjä tai ActiveX-ohjaimia sovelletaan seuraavassa linkissä esitettyjä ehtoja:
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_usage_fi. Sen lisäksi ja ellei edellä olevasta linkistä muuta johdu,
käyttäjällä ei ole oikeutta käyttää tai jaella kyseisiä ohjelmistoja.
16.10 Contribute Publishing Services. Contribute Publishing Services -ohjelman mukana toimitetun
loppukäyttäjän käyttöoikeussopimuksen ehtojen mukaisesti käyttäjä ei saa muodostaa yhteyttä
Contribute Publishing Services -ohjelmaan, ellei käyttäjä ole hankkinut tämän käyttöoikeutta jokaista
yksittäistä henkilöä kohti, jolla on mahdollisuus muodostaa siihen yhteys, edellyttäen kuitenkin, että
Adoben Contribute -ohjelman kokeiluversiot voidaan asentaa ja kytkeä Contribute Publishing Services -
ohjelmaan asianomaisen loppukäyttäjän käyttöoikeussopimuksen mukaisesti.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Mikäli ohjelmisto sisältää Adobe Presenter -ohjelman, ja jos käyttäjä asentaa
Adobe Acrobat Connect Add-in -sovelluksen ohjelmiston käytön yhteydessä tai käyttää sitä sen
yhteydessä, käyttäjä sitoutuu asentamaan Adobe Acrobat Connect Add-in -sovelluksen vain
pöytätietokoneeseen eikä muuhun laitteeseen ja käyttämään sitä ainoastaan siinä eikä muussa PC:stä
poikkeavassa laitteessa, mukaan lukien rajoituksetta verkkolaite, tv-sovitin (digitaalisovitin),
kämmentietokone, puhelin tai kosketusnäyttölaite. Tämän lisäksi ohjelmiston (Adobe Presenter Run-
Time) avulla luotuun, esitykseen, tietoihin tai sisältöön sulautetun ohjelmiston osaa saa käyttää
ainoastaan yhdessä esityksen, tietojen tai sisällön kanssa, johon se on sulautettu. Käyttäjä ei saa käyttää
ja käyttäjän tulee huolehtia siitä, ettei kukaan muukaan kyseiseen esitykseen, tietoihin tai sisältöön
käyttöoikeuden hankkinut käytä Adobe Presenter Run-Timea muutoin kuin kyseiseen esitykseen,
tietoihin tai sisältöön sulautettuna. Käyttäjä ei saa myöskään muokata Adobe Presenter Run-Time -
ohjelmaa, takaisinmallintaa tai purkaa sitä osiin, ja käyttäjän tulee huolehtia siitä, ettei kukaan muu
kyseiseen esitykseen, tietoihin tai sisältöön käyttöoikeuden hankkinut muokkaa Adobe Presenter Run‑

2. Licence de Logiciel ; Adhésion.
2.1 Licence de Logiciel. Le présent article 2.1 s’applique uniquement aux Clients qui ont acquis une
licence pour le Logiciel mais qui n’ont pas acquis une licence ou un service dépendants d’une adhésion
tels que l’adhésion au service Creative Cloud (tel que décrit à l’article 2.2).
2.1.1 Concession de Licence. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent Contrat et du paiement
des droits d’adhésion applicables, Adobe accorde au Client une licence non exclusive et limitée pour
installer et utiliser le Logiciel (a) sur le territoire ou dans la région dans laquelle le Client a acquis le
Logiciel auprès d’Adobe ou d’un revendeur agréé par Adobe ou de toute autre manière évoquée dans

autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles du Client tel que cela est spécifié dans la Documentation et
(d) conformément aux dispositions du présent Contrat et de la Documentation applicable. Sauf mention
contraire stipulée dans le présent Contrat, la Documentation applicable ou au moment de l’achat, la
Période de validité de la Licence est perpétuelle. Dès l’expiration ou la résiliation de la Période de
validité de la Licence, tout ou partie du Logiciel peut cesser de fonctionner sans préavis. Dès l’expiration
ou la résiliation de la Période de validité de la Licence, il n’est plus possible d’utiliser le Logiciel sauf si la
licence a été renouvelée. La licence concédée dans les présentes est complétée par des dispositions
spécifiques exposées à l’Article 16 relatives à l’usage de certains produits et composants adaptés
pouvant être inclus dans le Logiciel, tels que le logiciel de polices de caractères, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite et les Moteurs
d’exécution Adobe Runtime.
2.1.2 Types de Licence.
2.1.2.1 Logiciel sans numéro de série. Le Logiciel, ou les parties du Logiciel fournies sans numéro de
série au cours de la Période de validité de la Licence peuvent être installés et utilisés sur n’importe quel
nombre d’Ordinateurs dans le cadre d’un plan de déploiement d’entreprise pendant la Période de
validité de la Licence uniquement à des fins de démonstration, d’évaluation et de formation et
seulement si les Fichiers de sortie ou autres matériels créés par ce biais sont uniquement destinés à une
utilisation interne, non commerciale et non productive. LE LOGICIEL SANS NUMERO DE SERIE EST
FOURNI « EN L’ETAT ». L’ACCES A TOUS LES FICHIERS DE SORTIE CREES AVEC LEDIT LOGICIEL SANS
NUMERO DE SERIE, DE MEME QUE LEUR UTILISATION, S’EFFECTUENT AUX PROPRES RISQUES DU
CLIENT.
2.1.2.2 Logiciels d’Evaluation. Le Logiciel, ou les parties du Logiciel, fournis avec un numéro de série et
désignés « à des fins d’évaluation » ou avec une désignation identique (telle qu’un Logiciel ou un
numéro de série fourni comme « EVAL » dans un contrat distinct) (un « Logiciel d’évaluation »)
peuvent être installés et utilisés sur un Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles pendant la Période
de validité de la Licence, uniquement à des fins de démonstration, d’évaluation et de formation, et
--- Page 147 ---
seulement si les Fichiers de sortie ou autres matériels créés par ce biais sont uniquement destinés à une
utilisation interne, non commerciale et non productive. LE LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION EST FOURNI « EN
L’ETAT ». L’ACCES A TOUS LES FICHIERS DE SORTIE CREES AVEC LEDIT LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION, DE
MEME QUE LEUR UTILISATION, S’EFFECTUENT AUX PROPRES RISQUES DU CLIENT.
2.1.2.3 Abonnement. Pour les Logiciels disponibles moyennant un abonnement (l’« Abonnement »), le
Client ne peut installer et utiliser l’abonnement que sur un Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles
pendant la Période de validité de la Licence. En fonction du Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs pour
l’Abonnement, Adobe peut autoriser le Client à installer et à utiliser la version antérieure la plus récente
de l’Abonnement et la version actuelle de l’Abonnement sur le même Ordinateur pendant la Période de
validité de la Licence. Le Client accepte qu’Adobe puisse modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Abonnement à tout
moment et qu’il ne soit, en aucun cas, tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications. L’accès
continu à un Abonnement requiert : (a) une connexion permanente à Internet pour activer, renouveler
et valider la Licence, (b) la réception du paiement périodique de l’Abonnement par Adobe ou ses
revendeurs agréés et (c) l’acceptation par le Client des conditions d’abonnement et des autres
dispositions et conditions supplémentaires disponibles sur http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_fr
ou au moment de l’achat. Si Adobe ne reçoit pas le paiement périodique de l’abonnement ou ne peut
pas valider la licence régulièrement, il est possible que le Logiciel soit rendu inactif sans avis préalable
jusqu’à ce qu’Adobe reçoive le paiement ou valide la licence.
2.1.3 Utilisation sur Ordinateur Portable ou Privé. Sous réserve des limitations prévues à
l’Article 2.1.4, l’utilisateur principal de l’Ordinateur sur lequel le Logiciel est installé (l’« Utilisateur
principal »), peut, dans les limites décrites à l’Article 2.1, installer une seconde copie du Logiciel
pour son utilisation personnelle exclusivement sur un Ordinateur portable ou sur un Ordinateur
privé installé à son domicile personnel, à condition que le Logiciel installé sur cet Ordinateur
portable ou privé ne soit pas en même temps utilisé sur l’Ordinateur principal.
2.1.4 Limitations relatives à l’usage secondaire par les licenciés en volume. Dans le cas où le Logiciel
aurait été obtenu par un licencié autre qu’un licencié en volume d’éducation par le biais d’un
programme ou un contrat de licence en volume Adobe (par exemple, « Achat de licences en
volume »), la seconde copie du Logiciel effectuée en application de l’Article 2.1.3 ne peut être utilisée
qu’au bénéfice et dans le cadre de l’activité dudit licencié en volume.
2.1.5 Configuration à amorçage double. Le Logiciel est sous licence pour l’utilisation sur un système
d’exploitation bien précis. Le Client doit acheter une licence distincte pour l’usage du Logiciel sur
chaque système d’exploitation. Si le Client souhaite, par exemple, installer le Logiciel sur les systèmes
d’exploitation Mac OS et Windows sur un même ordinateur qui exécute ces deux plates-formes (c’est-à-
dire, une machine à amorçage double), il doit obtenir deux licences individuelles du Logiciel. Cela
s’applique même si les deux versions du Logiciel, conçues pour différents systèmes d’exploitation, sont
fournies sur le même support.
2.1.6 Distribution via un serveur. Le Client est autorisé par la Documentation à copier une image du
Logiciel sur un serveur de fichiers informatiques du Réseau interne du Client (le « Serveur ») afin de
télécharger et d’installer le Logiciel sur d’autres Ordinateurs appartenant au même Réseau interne
uniquement dans les limites décrites au présent Article 2.
2.1.7 Utilisation du serveur.
2.1.7.1 Comme le permet un document d’achat distinct ou la Documentation et sous réserve des
limitations de la licence exposées dans le présent Contrat, le Client peut installer le Logiciel sur un
Serveur dans le seul but de permettre l’accès et l’utilisation du Logiciel à une personne à partir d’un
Ordinateur appartenant au même Réseau interne (l’« Utilisateur du réseau »). L’Utilisateur du réseau
qui a accès au dit Logiciel sur le Serveur est désigné par l’expression « Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le
Serveur ». Le nombre total d’Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le Serveur (et non le nombre d’utilisateurs
simultanés) ne peut pas dépasser le Nombre autorisé. A titre d’exemple, si le Client a acheté 10 licences
du Logiciel (le Nombre autorisé est 10) et qu’il choisit d’installer le Logiciel sur un Serveur, le Client ne
--- Page 148 ---
peut autoriser que 10 Utilisateurs du Logiciel sur le Serveur à accéder au Logiciel (même s’il peut y avoir
plus de 10 Utilisateurs du réseau ou moins de 10 utilisateurs simultanés du Logiciel).
2.1.7.2 Afin d’apporter davantage d’explications et sans limitations, ce qui précède n’autorise pas le
Client à installer le Logiciel ou à y accéder (que ce soit directement ou à l’aide de commandes, de
données ou d’instructions) : (a) depuis, ou à destination d’un Ordinateur ne faisant pas partie du Réseau
interne du Client ; (b) pour activer des groupes de travail ou des services hébergés sur le Web
accessibles à tous ; (c) par une personne physique ou morale non habilitée à utiliser, télécharger, copier
la fonctionnalité du Logiciel ou à en bénéficier, d’une manière quelconque, sauf sous licence d’Adobe ;
(d) en tant que composant d’un système, d’un flux de travaux ou d’un service accessible par plus
d’utilisateurs que le Nombre autorisé ou (e) pour des opérations qui ne sont pas initiées par un
utilisateur individuel (par exemple, le traitement automatisé des données sur un serveur).
2.2 Adhésion. Le présent Article 2.2 s’applique aux Clients qui ont acquis une licence ou un service
dépendants d’une adhésion tels que l’adhésion au service Creative Cloud (collectivement,
l’« Adhésion »).
2.2.1 Services en ligne d’Adobe relatifs à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent
Contrat et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client un
droit non exclusif et limité sur tout le Territoire pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel ainsi que les Services
en ligne d’Adobe connexes (conformément aux dispositions ultérieures de l’Article 16.4.1) dans le cadre
de l’Adhésion, soumis aux conditions évoquées dans le présent Contrat et aux Conditions d’utilisation
supplémentaires (telles que définies ci-dessous à l’Article 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Licence de Logiciel relative à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent Contrat
et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client une licence
non exclusive et limitée pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel : (a) sur le Territoire, (b) pendant la période
de validité et d’activation de l’Adhésion (la « Durée d’adhésion ») et (c) conformément aux conditions
du présent Contrat et à la Documentation applicable. Dès l’expiration ou la résiliation de la Durée
d’adhésion, (x) tout ou partie du Logiciel peut cesser de fonctionner sans notification préalable et (y) le
Client n’est plus autorisé à utiliser le Logiciel à moins que l’adhésion n’ait été renouvelée. Toutes les
conditions relatives au Logiciel spécifique telles qu’indiquées dans le présent Contrat restent effectives
et s’appliquent toujours au Client et à son utilisation dudit Logiciel.
2.2.3 Limitations. Le Client accepte les dispositions et les limitations supplémentaires suivantes relatives
à l’Adhésion : (a) Adobe peut modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les produits spécifiques, les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Adhésion à tout moment et
n’est en aucun cas tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications ; (b) le Client peut être
obligé de se connecter à Internet et de saisir ses informations de connexion à tout moment pendant la
Durée de l’adhésion ; (c) le Logiciel peut se connecter automatiquement à Internet afin de vérifier
l’Adhésion du Client sans notification préalable à tout moment et (d) le Client ne doit pas habiliter ou
autoriser d’autres personnes à utiliser le Logiciel en son nom.
2.3 Fichiers de contenu. Sauf dispositions contraires contenues dans les fichiers « Lisez-moi », la
Documentation ou toute autre licence associée aux Fichiers de contenu, le Client est autorisé à utiliser,
afficher à l’écran, modifier, reproduire et distribuer tous les Fichiers de contenu. Toutefois, le Client n’est
pas autorisé à distribuer les Fichiers de contenu seuls (c’est-à-dire s’ils constituent la valeur principale du
produit distribué) et n’est pas autorisé à revendiquer un droit sur une marque relative aux Fichiers de
contenu ou à toute œuvre dérivée. Aucune de ces dispositions n’affecte la propriété du Logiciel selon
l’Article 3.
2.4 Exemple de code d’application. Le Client a la possibilité de modifier le format du code source des
Logiciels qui sont expressément identifiés comme des exemples de code, exemples de code
d’application, fragments de code, fichiers de classe ActionScript ou exemples de composants (chacun
constituant un « Exemple de code d’application ») dans la Documentation accompagnant ces derniers,
uniquement à des fins de conception, de développement et de contrôle de sites Web et d’applications
développés en utilisant des logiciels Adobe ; sous réserve de n’être autorisé à copier et à distribuer
--- Page 149 ---
l’Exemple de code d’application (modifié ou non modifié) qu’à condition de respecter l’ensemble des
conditions suivantes : (a) que le Client distribue uniquement les versions de l’objet compilé de
l’Exemple de code d’application avec son application ; (b) que le Client n’inclut pas l’Exemple de code
d’application dans un produit ou une application conçu à des fins de développement de site Web ; et
(c) qu’il n’utilise pas le nom d’Adobe, les logos, les icônes ou les autres marques d’Adobe pour
commercialiser son application. Le Client s’engage à indemniser, à exempter de toute responsabilité et
à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris
les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler ou résulter de l’usage ou de la distribution de son application.
2.5 Langages de programmation. Le Logiciel peut comprendre des parties du kit de développement
logiciel (le « SDK », « Software Development Kit ») d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender. Sous réserve des
limitations contenues dans le présent Article 2, Adobe confère au Client une licence non exclusive, non
cessible et libre de droits uniquement en vue d’utiliser les éléments du SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel
Bender dans le cadre d’activités de développement interne de programmes d’application destinés à
fonctionner avec les produits Adobe. Sauf disposition explicite contraire à l’Article 2.5, aucune autre
partie des SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender ne peut être modifiée ou distribuée. Le Client s’engage
à indemniser, à exempter de toute responsabilité et à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout
dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler
ou résulter de cette distribution.
2.6 Copies de la Documentation. Le Client est autorisé à effectuer des copies de la Documentation pour
son usage interne dans le cadre de l’utilisation du Logiciel conformément au présent contrat, dans la
limite d’un nombre raisonnablement nécessaire.
3. Titularité des droits de propriété intellectuelle.
Le Logiciel et toutes copies que le Client est autorisé à faire sont la propriété intellectuelle d’Adobe
Systems Incorporated et des fournisseurs qui les détiennent. La structure, l’organisation et le code

Systems Incorporated et de ses fournisseurs. Le Logiciel est protégé par la loi, y compris notamment par
les lois des Etats-Unis et d’autres pays sur le droit d’auteur et par les dispositions des traités
internationaux. Sauf disposition explicite contraire dans le présent contrat, celui-ci ne concède au Client
aucun droit de propriété intellectuelle sur le Logiciel. Tous les droits non expressément accordés sont
réservés par Adobe et ses fournisseurs.
4. Limitations et exigences.
4.1 Mentions de propriété. Toute copie autorisée du Logiciel (y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, de la
Documentation) que le Client effectue doit contenir les mêmes mentions de droits d’auteur et autres
droits de propriété que celles qui apparaissent sur ou dans le Logiciel.

sous-entend pas ou ne crée pas de droits d’utilisation permanents du Logiciel après la résiliation du
présent contrat.
8. Limitation de responsabilité.
SAUF DANS LE CADRE DU RECOURS EXCLUSIF CONCEDE CI-DESSUS PAR ADOBE ET DE TOUT
RECOURS NE POUVANT ETRE LEGALEMENT EXCLU OU LIMITE, ADOBE, SES FILIALES, SES
FOURNISSEURS ET SES AUTORITES DE CERTIFICATION NE SERONT EN AUCUN CAS RESPONSABLES

VERSE POUR LE LOGICIEL, S’IL Y A LIEU. LA PRESENTE LIMITATION S’APPLIQUE MEME EN CAS DE
MANQUEMENT GRAVE OU DE MANQUEMENT A DES DISPOSITIONS ESSENTIELLES DU PRESENT
CONTRAT. Aucune disposition du présent contrat ne limite la responsabilité d’Adobe envers le Client en
cas de décès ou de préjudices corporels résultant d’une négligence de la part d’Adobe ou d’un acte
frauduleux. Adobe agit pour le compte de ses filiales, fournisseurs et Autorités de certification afin de
rejeter, d’exclure et de limiter les obligations, les garanties et les responsabilités, mais à aucun autre
égard et dans aucun autre but.

L’ARTICLE 16 POUR CONNAITRE LES CONDITIONS SPECIFIQUES DE VOTRE JURIDICTION.
9. Exportation.
Le Client reconnaît que le Logiciel est régi par les dispositions de l’administration américaine des
exportations (« EAR », Export Administration Regulations) auxquelles il doit se conformer. Le Client
s’engage à ne pas exporter ou réexporter le Logiciel, directement ou indirectement, vers : (a) des pays
soumis à des restrictions à l’exportation depuis les Etats-Unis (comprenant actuellement, sans s’y limiter,
Cuba, l’Iran, la Corée du Nord, le Soudan et la Syrie) ; (b) tout utilisateur final dont le Client sait ou a des
raisons de croire qu’il l’utilisera pour concevoir, développer ou produire des armes nucléaires,
chimiques ou biologiques, ou des systèmes de roquettes, des véhicules de lancement spatial et des
fusées-sondes, ou des systèmes d’avions sans pilote ; ou (c) tout utilisateur final qui s’est vu interdire par
un quelconque bureau fédéral du gouvernement américain de participer à des transactions
d’exportation depuis les Etats-Unis. Le Client est en outre tenu de se conformer aux réglementations
locales en vigueur dans sa juridiction, ce qui peut influer son droit à importer, exporter ou utiliser le
--- Page 153 ---
Logiciel. Si Adobe a connaissance qu’une violation s’est produite, Adobe peut se voir interdire d’assurer
la maintenance et l’assistance technique du Logiciel.
10. Droit applicable.
Si le Client est un consommateur utilisant le Logiciel uniquement à des fins personnelles et non
commerciales, le présent contrat est régi par les lois de la juridiction dans laquelle le Client a acheté la
licence d’utilisation du Logiciel. Si le Client n’appartient pas à cette catégorie de clientèle, le présent

Californie, du Tokyo District Court au Japon, lorsque s’applique la loi du Japon, et les tribunaux
compétents de Londres en Angleterre, lorsque s’applique la loi britannique et galloise, ont chacun
compétence non exclusive en cas de litiges relatifs au présent contrat. Lorsque s’applique la loi de
Singapour, tout litige découlant du présent contrat, ou en rapport avec ce dernier, notamment toute
question quant à son existence, sa validité ou sa résiliation est définitivement réglée par arbitrage à
Singapour, conformément au Règlement d’arbitrage du Centre d’arbitrage international de Singapour
(SIAC) tant qu’il est en vigueur, dont les règles sont réputées incorporées par référence au présent
article. Un arbitre unique sera désigné d’un commun accord entre les parties. Si les parties ne
parviennent pas à s’entendre sur la désignation d’un arbitre dans les trente (30) jours suivant la
demande écrite de soumission à arbitrage par l’une d’elles, l’arbitre sera nommé par le Président du
SIAC. La langue de l’arbitrage sera l’anglais. Nonobstant toute disposition du présent contrat, Adobe ou
le Client pourra faire appel à une autorité judiciaire, administrative ou autre afin de demander une
mesure provisoire ou conservatoire, y compris une mesure d’injonction, une action spécifique ou toute
autre mesure équitable, avant l’institution de procédures légales ou d’arbitrage, ou au cours des
procédures, pour préserver les droits du Client et ses intérêts ou pour faire appliquer des dispositions
spécifiques adaptées aux recours provisoires. Ce Contrat ne sera pas régi par ce qui suit, dont
l’application est explicitement exclue par les présentes : (x) les règles en matière de conflit de lois d’un
pays, (y) la Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises et
(z) la loi UCITA (Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act), telle qu’édictée dans toute
juridiction.
11. Dispositions générales.
Si l’une quelconque des stipulations du présent contrat s’avère nulle et inopposable, la validité et
l’opposabilité des autres stipulations n’en seront pas affectées. Le présent contrat ne peut être modifié
que par un document écrit et signé par un responsable d’Adobe dûment habilité à cet effet. En ce qui
concerne l’interprétation du contrat, la version anglaise fera foi. Ce document constitue l’intégralité du
contrat conclu entre Adobe et le Client concernant le Logiciel. Il se substitue à l’ensemble des
déclarations, discussions, engagements, communications ou publicités antérieurs relatifs au Logiciel.

--- Page 154 ---
applicables sur l’égalité des chances, y compris, s’il y a lieu, aux dispositions du décret-loi (Executive
Order) 11246, telles que modifiées, du paragraphe 402 de la Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment
Assistance Act (loi sur l’aide à la réadaptation des vétérans du Vietnam) de 1974 (38 USC 4212) et du
paragraphe 503 de la Rehabilitation Act (loi sur la réhabilitation) de 1973, tel que modifié, et aux
réglementations spécifiées à l’article 41 CFR, paragraphes 60-1 à 60-60, 60-250 et 60-741. Les
réglementations et les dispositions relatives aux actions affirmatives contenues dans la phrase
précédente seront intégrées par référence au présent contrat.
12.2 Articles commerciaux. Pour les Utilisateurs finaux du gouvernement des Etats-Unis, le Logiciel est
un « Article commercial » tel que défini au paragraphe 2.101 de l’Article 48 C.F.R. (Code de
réglementations fédérales), consistant en un « Logiciel informatique commercial » et une
« Documentation de logiciel informatique commercial », tels que définis au paragraphe 12.212 de

conformément aux lois des Etats-Unis relatives aux droits d’auteur.
13. Respect des licences.
Si le Client a une activité commerciale, une société ou un organisme, il s’engage, outre les contrôles de
conformité de licence effectués par le Logiciel, à autoriser l’inspection de ses registres, systèmes et
installations par Adobe ou l’un de ses représentants agréés, pour vérifier que le Client utilise les logiciels
ou les services d’Adobe en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur, au maximum une fois tous
les douze (12) mois et dans les sept (7) jours ouvrables suivant la demande. Par exemple, Adobe a le
droit d’inspecter certains des enregistrements du Client qui seront utiles afin de déterminer si les
numéros de série ont été entrés pour les installations du Logiciel et le Client devra fournir ces
enregistrements rapidement sur demande d’Adobe. Le Client devra en outre fournir à Adobe tous les
registres et toutes les informations demandés par Adobe pour vérifier qu’il utilise les logiciels d’Adobe
en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur dans les trente (30) jours suivant toute demande
d’Adobe. Pour plus d’informations sur les numéros de série, consultez la page
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_fr.
14. Connectivité à Internet et confidentialité.
14.1 Connexions automatiques à Internet. Le Logiciel peut entraîner la connexion automatique de
l’Ordinateur à Internet, sans notification, ainsi que la communication avec un site Web ou un domaine
d’Adobe dans le but de valider la licence et de fournir au Client des informations supplémentaires, des
caractéristiques et des fonctionnalités. Sauf indication contraire dans les Articles 14.2 à 14.7, les
dispositions suivantes s’appliquent à toute connexion du Logiciel à Internet :
14.1.1 Lorsque le Logiciel se connecte à Internet et communique avec un site Web d’Adobe, aussi bien
automatiquement que sur requête explicite de l’utilisateur, la Charte de traitement des données
personnelles est applicable. La Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe autorise le suivi
des visites sur les sites Web et aborde en détail le sujet du suivi et l’utilisation de cookies, de pixels
invisibles et d’autres dispositifs semblables.
14.1.2 Chaque fois que le Logiciel se connecte à Adobe sur Internet, certaines informations relatives au
Client sont collectées et transmises par le Logiciel à Adobe conformément à la Charte de traitement des
données personnelles d’Adobe disponible sur http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr (la « Charte de
traitement des données personnelles »).
--- Page 155 ---
14.1.3 Si le Client accède aux Services en ligne d’Adobe (tels que définis à l’Article 16.4 ci-dessous),
active ou enregistre le Logiciel, des informations supplémentaires telles que l’identifiant Adobe, le nom
d’utilisateur et le mot de passe du Client peuvent être transmises à Adobe et stockées conformément à
la Charte de traitement des données personnelles et aux conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires
relatives auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe (collectivement avec les conditions d’utilisation
d’Adobe.com et toute condition applicable, les « Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires »).
14.1.4 Conformément à la loi en vigueur ou si le Client y consent, Adobe peut (a) envoyer au Client des
messages transactionnels visant à faciliter l’utilisation des Services en ligne d’Adobe, l’activation ou
l’enregistrement du Logiciel ou des Services en ligne d’Adobe ou (b) intégrer des supports marketing
dans le produit afin de fournir des informations sur le Logiciel et d’autres produits et Services Adobe y
compris notamment la version de la plate-forme, la version du Logiciel, l’état de la licence et la langue.
14.2 Mise à jour. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur à
Internet (par intermittence ou régulièrement) afin de (a) vérifier la disponibilité de Mises à jour à
télécharger et à installer sur l’Ordinateur du Client et (b) informer Adobe du résultat de l’installation.
14.3 Activation. Le Logiciel peut exiger que le Client (a) obtienne un identifiant Adobe, (b) active ou
réactive le Logiciel, (c) enregistre le Logiciel ou (d) valide l’Adhésion. Ces conditions peuvent entraîner
la connexion de l’Ordinateur à Internet sans notification à l’installation, au lancement et à intervalles
réguliers par la suite. Une fois connecté, le Logiciel collectera et transmettra des informations à Adobe
comme décrit en détail sur http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr (les « Conditions d’activation »). Le
Logiciel ou le Client peut recevoir des informations provenant d’Adobe relatives à la licence, à
l’inscription ou à l’Adhésion du Client. Adobe peut utiliser lesdites informations pour détecter ou
empêcher toute utilisation qui serait frauduleuse ou non autorisée et non conforme aux conditions
d’utilisation d’une licence valide, d’une inscription ou d’une Adhésion. Si le Logiciel n’est pas activé ou
enregistré, si l’inscription ou l’Adhésion n’est pas validée ou si Adobe remarque une utilisation
frauduleuse ou non autorisée du Logiciel, le Logiciel peut alors cesser de fonctionner, ses fonctionnalités
peuvent s’avérer limitées et l’inscription ou l’Adhésion peuvent être résiliées ou suspendues.
14.4 Désactivation. Le Client peut désactiver et désinstaller le Logiciel de son Ordinateur afin d’installer
ou d’activer le Logiciel sur un autre Ordinateur conformément au présent contrat (la « Désactivation »)
et de la façon décrite en détail à l’adresse http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr. La Désactivation
nécessite une connexion à Internet.
14.5 Utilisation des Services en ligne. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, par intermittence ou
régulièrement, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur du Client à Internet pour faciliter l’accès au
contenu et aux services offerts par Adobe ou des tiers comme décrit ultérieurement à l’Article 16.4
(Services en ligne). Le Logiciel peut en outre, sans avis supplémentaire, accéder à Internet pour
télécharger automatiquement des mises à jour depuis ces services en ligne pour les mettre à disposition
du Client immédiatement, même lorsque ce dernier est hors ligne.
14.6 Certificats numériques. Le Logiciel utilise des certificats numériques (tels que décrits à l’Article 16.5)
pour aider le Client à identifier les fichiers téléchargés (c’est-à-dire, les applications et leur contenu) ainsi
que les éditeurs de ces fichiers. Par exemple, Adobe AIR utilise les certificats numériques pour aider le
Client à identifier l’éditeur des applications Adobe AIR. La gamme de produits Adobe utilise également
des certificats numériques pour signer et valider les signatures dans les documents PDF (Portable
Document Format) ainsi que pour valider les documents PDF certifiés. L’Ordinateur du Client peut se
connecter à Internet au moment de la validation du certificat numérique.
14.7 Gestionnaire de configuration. Le Logiciel peut inclure Flash Player. Flash Player peut sauvegarder
certains paramètres utilisateur en les stockant sur l’Ordinateur du Client comme objet local partagé. Ils
sont associés à l’instance de Flash Player sur l’Ordinateur afin que le Client puisse personnaliser les
fonctions d’exécution. Grâce au Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player, le Client peut modifier
ces paramètres, notamment la limitation du stockage d’objets partagés locaux par des tiers ou
l’autorisation d’accès au microphone et à la caméra de l’ordinateur par du contenu tiers. Pour plus
d’informations sur la configuration des paramètres dans votre version de Flash Player, notamment sur la
--- Page 156 ---
désactivation des objets partagés locaux à l’aide du Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player,
reportez-vous à http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_fr. Pour plus d’informations sur les objets
partagés locaux, consultez la page http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_fr.
15. Communications poste à poste.
Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, utiliser la connexion au réseau local du Client pour se
connecter automatiquement à d’autres logiciels Adobe et peut indiquer, de ce fait, qu’il est ouvert à des
communications provenant d’autres logiciels Adobe. Ces connexions peuvent transmettre l’adresse IP
de la connexion du Client au réseau local.
16. Dispositions particulières et exceptions.
Le présent Article expose les dispositions spécifiques relatives à certains produits et composants du
Logiciel, ainsi que certaines exceptions aux dispositions ci-dessus. Si une disposition du présent Article
est en contradiction avec une autre disposition du présent contrat, les dispositions du présent Article
prévaudront.
16.1 Préjudice ; dispositions pour l’Espace économique européen ; avis obligatoire pour l’Australie.
16.1.1 Le présent contrat ne porte pas préjudice aux droits légaux de toute partie, y compris les parties
qui agissent en qualité de consommateurs. Par exemple, dans le cas de consommateurs néo-zélandais
obtenant le Logiciel pour une utilisation personnelle ou domestique (et non à des fins commerciales), le
présent contrat est soumis au Consumer Guarantees Act (Loi néo-zélandaise sur la protection des
consommateurs).
16.1.2 Si le Client a obtenu le Logiciel dans l’Espace économique européen (EEE), s’il réside dans l’EEE et
si le Client est un consommateur (c’est-à-dire s’il utilise le Logiciel à des fins personnelles non
commerciales), l’Article 6 (Garantie limitée) ne s’applique alors pas à l’achat du Logiciel effectué par le
Client ni à l’utilisation qu’il en fait. En lieu et place, Adobe garantit, pour une période de 2 ans à compter
de la date d’achat, que le Logiciel offre les fonctionnalités énoncées dans le manuel de l’utilisateur
applicable (les « Fonctionnalités convenues dans le contrat ») lorsqu’il est utilisé sur l’Ordinateur
compatible. De légères variations de performances par rapport aux Fonctionnalités convenues dans le
contrat ne sauraient donner lieu à une application de la garantie. LA PRESENTE GARANTIE NE
S’APPLIQUE PAS AUX LOGICIELS QUE LE CLIENT UTILISE EN PREVERSION, VERSION D’ESSAI, VERSION
D’APPRENTISSAGE, ECHANTILLON DE PRODUIT, OU AUX LOGICIELS DE POLICES DE CARACTERES OU
SI DES MODIFICATIONS APPORTEES AUX LOGICIELS PAR LE CLIENT ENTRAINENT L’APPARITION D’UN
DEFAUT. Pour invoquer la garantie, le Client doit avertir le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe
pendant cette période de 2 ans et fournir les détails de la preuve d’achat du Logiciel. Adobe aidera le
Client à vérifier si un défaut existe dans le Logiciel ou lui indiquera si l’erreur est due à une installation
incorrecte du Logiciel (auquel cas Adobe aidera le Client). S’il y a un défaut dans le Logiciel, le Client
peut réclamer à Adobe un remboursement, une réparation ou une copie de remplacement du Logiciel.
Toute demande doit être accompagnée d’une preuve d’achat. Dans le cas où les détails de la garantie
du Client sont vérifiés, Adobe répondra à sa demande de réparation ou de remplacement du Logiciel,
sauf si une telle demande n’est pas jugée raisonnable par Adobe, auquel cas Adobe remboursera le
Client. Veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe si vous avez besoin d’aide au sujet de
cette garantie.
Veuillez noter que les dispositions relatives à l’Article 8 (Limite de responsabilité) s’appliqueront
toujours aux réclamations pour dommage relatives à l’utilisation du Logiciel par le Client. Néanmoins,
Adobe sera responsable pour tout dommage direct raisonnablement prévisible en cas de violation du
présent contrat par Adobe. Il est conseillé au Client de prendre toutes les mesures raisonnables pour
éviter et limiter les dommages, en particulier en faisant des copies de sauvegarde du Logiciel et de ses
données informatiques.
--- Page 157 ---
Ce contrat, et en particulier le présent Article 16.1.2, est destiné à décrire les droits du Client (y compris
ses droits légaux) dans le cas où celui-ci rencontrerait des problèmes suite à son utilisation du Logiciel.
Dans le cas où ils offrent au Client une protection supérieure à cette description, les droits légaux
s’appliquent.
16.1.3 Aucune disposition dans le présent contrat (y compris l’Article 4.4) ne limite le droit inaliénable
de décompiler le Logiciel dont le Client dispose en vertu de la loi en vigueur. Par exemple, si le Client
réside dans l’Union européenne (UE), il peut avoir le droit, sous certaines conditions énoncées dans la
loi en vigueur, de décompiler le Logiciel si cela est nécessaire pour assurer l’interopérabilité du Logiciel
avec un autre programme informatique, et si le Client a demandé auparavant par écrit les informations
permettant d’accéder à cette interopérabilité à Adobe et si Adobe ne lui a pas communiqué ces
informations. En outre, la décompilation peut uniquement être effectuée par le Client ou une autre
personne autorisée à utiliser une copie du Logiciel pour le compte du Client. Adobe se réserve le droit
d’imposer des conditions raisonnables avant de fournir de telles informations. Toute information fournie
par Adobe ou obtenue par le Client, tel qu’autorisé dans les présentes, ne peut être utilisée que par le
Client aux fins spécifiées aux présentes et ne peut être communiquée à un tiers quel qu’il soit ou utilisée
pour créer un logiciel qui serait en substance similaire au Logiciel ou utilisée à toutes autres fins en
violation avec les droits d’auteur d’Adobe ou de ses concédants.
16.1.4 Si le Client obtient le Logiciel en Australie, les dispositions suivantes seront d’application,
nonobstant toute disposition contraire dans le présent Contrat :
AVIS AUX CONSOMMATEURS RÉSIDANT EN AUSTRALIE :
Nos produits sont accompagnés de garanties qui ne peuvent être exclues en vertu de la législation
applicable aux consommateurs australiens. Vous avez droit au remplacement ou au remboursement du
produit en cas de défaillance majeure et à un dédommagement pour tout autre dommage ou perte
raisonnablement prévisible. Vous pouvez également bénéficier de la réparation ou du remplacement
des produits en cas de qualité non acceptable de ceux-ci et si la défaillance n’est pas considérée comme
majeure. Nos logiciels sont également accompagnés d’une garantie limitée de 90 jours accordée par
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, dont les bureaux se situent au 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest
Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irlande, ainsi que stipulé dans le Contrat. Si vos produits ne présentent pas
les caractéristiques et fonctions générales décrites dans la Documentation utilisateur dans les 90 jours
suivant leur livraison, veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe au 1800 614 863 en
fournissant les détails du produit, le numéro de série et la preuve d’achat. Vous pourrez être invité à
renvoyer le logiciel à l’adresse que nous vous indiquerons à ce moment-là, auquel cas les frais de retour
seront à votre charge. Les avantages au titre de cette garantie viennent s’ajouter aux autres droits de
recours que pourrait vous offrir la législation.
16.2 Clauses supplémentaires concernant la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si le Logiciel est une
version commerciale préliminaire ou s’il s’agit d’un logiciel bêta (une « Version préliminaire du
Logiciel »), le présent Article s’applique. La Version préliminaire du Logiciel n’est en aucun cas la
version finale du produit d’Adobe, qui peut contenir des bogues, des erreurs et d’autres problèmes
pouvant affecter le fonctionnement du système et engendrer des pannes et des pertes de données.
Adobe peut ne jamais commercialiser la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si la Version préliminaire du
Logiciel a été fournie au Client dans le cadre d’un contrat écrit séparé, tel que le Contrat de licence
d’Adobe Systems Incorporated pour la Version préliminaire du Logiciel, l’utilisation du Logiciel est
également soumise aux conditions dudit contrat. Le Client s’engage à renvoyer ou à détruire
rapidement toutes les copies de la Version préliminaire du Logiciel à la demande d’Adobe ou lorsque
cette dernière commercialisera ledit Logiciel, selon la situation qui se présente en premier. LE CLIENT
UTILISE LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL A SES PROPRES RISQUES. VEUILLEZ VOUS
REPORTER AUX ARTICLES 6 ET 8 CONCERNANT LA GARANTIE LIMITEE ET LES LIMITATIONS DE
RESPONSABILITE RELATIVES A LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL.

16.4 Services en ligne.
16.4.1 Offerts par Adobe. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès à différents contenus et services hébergés par
des sites Web gérés par Adobe ou ses filiales (les « Services en ligne d’Adobe »). Ces Services en ligne
d’Adobe comprennent notamment : Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital
Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help et les pages d’accueil des produits. Bien qu’il se trouve
sur un site Web, un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut parfois apparaître comme une fonctionnalité ou une
extension du Logiciel. L’accès à un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut exiger du Client qu’il active le Logiciel,
obtienne un identifiant Adobe, accepte des Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires ou nécessiter un
abonnement différent afin d’accéder auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe. Les Services en ligne d’Adobe
ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays.
Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité
de tout Service en ligne d’Adobe. Adobe se réserve aussi le droit de commencer à facturer l’accès à un
Service en ligne d’Adobe préalablement gratuit. L’Article 14 mentionne des informations importantes
concernant la connectivité à Internet et la protection des données personnelles du Client. Comme décrit
à l’Article 14, lorsque le Logiciel accède à un Service en ligne d’Adobe, l’utilisation de ce Service est
régie par la Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr), par les Conditions d’utilisation d’Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_fr) et par toutes autres Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires qui
peuvent alors être présentées au Client.
16.4.2 Offerts par des tiers. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès du Client à des sites Web gérés par des tiers
proposant des produits, des informations, des logiciels et des services (« Service(s) en ligne tiers »). Ces
Services en ligne tiers incluent notamment le service Kodak EasyShare Gallery. L’accès du Client aux
Services en ligne tiers et leur utilisation sont régis par les dispositions, conditions, exclusions et
notifications disponibles sur le site en question ou associés d’une autre manière à ces Services en ligne
tiers. Adobe ne contrôle pas et ne cautionne pas les Services en ligne tiers et n’assume aucune
responsabilité vis-à-vis de ceux-ci. Toute transaction entre le Client et un tiers concernant un Service en
ligne tiers, y compris les chartes de protection des données personnelles et l’utilisation des informations
personnelles du Client par ces tiers, la livraison et le paiement de biens et de services ainsi que toutes
autres dispositions, conditions, garanties ou déclarations liées à ces transactions ne concernent que le
Client et ce tiers. Les Services en ligne tiers ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues
ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays. Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce
soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité de tout Service en ligne tiers.
16.4.3 SAUF ACCORD EXPLICITE CONTRAIRE D’ADOBE, DE SES FILIALES OU D’UN TIERS DANS UN
CONTRAT DISTINCT, LE CLIENT UTILISE LES SERVICES EN LIGNE D’ADOBE ET DE TIERS A SES PROPRES
RISQUES, CONFORMEMENT AUX LIMITATIONS DE GARANTIE ET DE RESPONSABILITE DECRITES AUX
ARTICLES 7 ET 8.
16.5 Certificats numériques.
16.5.1 Utilisation. Les certificats numériques sont délivrés par des Autorités de certification tierces, y
compris les fournisseurs d’Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) publiés sur la page

utilisation interne, non commerciale et non productive. LE LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION EST FOURNI « EN
L’ETAT ». L’ACCES A TOUS LES FICHIERS DE SORTIE CREES AVEC LEDIT LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION, DE
MEME QUE LEUR UTILISATION, S’EFFECTUENT AUX PROPRES RISQUES DU CLIENT.
2.1.2.3 Abonnement. Pour les Logiciels disponibles moyennant un abonnement (l’« Abonnement »), le
Client ne peut installer et utiliser l’abonnement que sur un Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles
pendant la Période de validité de la Licence. En fonction du Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs pour
l’Abonnement, Adobe peut autoriser le Client à installer et à utiliser la version antérieure la plus récente
de l’Abonnement et la version actuelle de l’Abonnement sur le même Ordinateur pendant la Période de
validité de la Licence. Le Client accepte qu’Adobe puisse modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Abonnement à tout
moment et qu’il ne soit, en aucun cas, tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications. L’accès
continu à un Abonnement requiert : (a) une connexion permanente à Internet pour activer, renouveler
et valider la Licence, (b) la réception du paiement périodique de l’Abonnement par Adobe ou ses
revendeurs agréés et (c) l’acceptation par le Client des conditions d’abonnement et des autres
dispositions et conditions supplémentaires disponibles sur http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_fr
ou au moment de l’achat. Si Adobe ne reçoit pas le paiement périodique de l’abonnement ou ne peut
pas valider la licence régulièrement, il est possible que le Logiciel soit rendu inactif sans avis préalable
jusqu’à ce qu’Adobe reçoive le paiement ou valide la licence.
2.1.3 Utilisation sur Ordinateur Portable ou Privé. Sous réserve des limitations prévues à
l’Article 2.1.4, l’utilisateur principal de l’Ordinateur sur lequel le Logiciel est installé (l’« Utilisateur
principal »), peut, dans les limites décrites à l’Article 2.1, installer une seconde copie du Logiciel
pour son utilisation personnelle exclusivement sur un Ordinateur portable ou sur un Ordinateur
privé installé à son domicile personnel, à condition que le Logiciel installé sur cet Ordinateur
portable ou privé ne soit pas en même temps utilisé sur l’Ordinateur principal.
2.1.4 Limitations relatives à l’usage secondaire par les licenciés en volume. Dans le cas où le Logiciel
aurait été obtenu par un licencié autre qu’un licencié en volume d’éducation par le biais d’un
programme ou un contrat de licence en volume Adobe (par exemple, « Achat de licences en
volume »), la seconde copie du Logiciel effectuée en application de l’Article 2.1.3 ne peut être utilisée
qu’au bénéfice et dans le cadre de l’activité dudit licencié en volume.
2.1.5 Configuration à amorçage double. Le Logiciel est sous licence pour l’utilisation sur un système
d’exploitation bien précis. Le Client doit acheter une licence distincte pour l’usage du Logiciel sur
chaque système d’exploitation. Si le Client souhaite, par exemple, installer le Logiciel sur les systèmes
d’exploitation Mac OS et Windows sur un même ordinateur qui exécute ces deux plates-formes (c’est-à-
dire, une machine à amorçage double), il doit obtenir deux licences individuelles du Logiciel. Cela
s’applique même si les deux versions du Logiciel, conçues pour différents systèmes d’exploitation, sont
fournies sur le même support.
2.1.6 Distribution via un serveur. Le Client est autorisé par la Documentation à copier une image du
Logiciel sur un serveur de fichiers informatiques du Réseau interne du Client (le « Serveur ») afin de
télécharger et d’installer le Logiciel sur d’autres Ordinateurs appartenant au même Réseau interne
uniquement dans les limites décrites au présent Article 2.
2.1.7 Utilisation du serveur.
2.1.7.1 Comme le permet un document d’achat distinct ou la Documentation et sous réserve des
limitations de la licence exposées dans le présent Contrat, le Client peut installer le Logiciel sur un
Serveur dans le seul but de permettre l’accès et l’utilisation du Logiciel à une personne à partir d’un
Ordinateur appartenant au même Réseau interne (l’« Utilisateur du réseau »). L’Utilisateur du réseau
qui a accès au dit Logiciel sur le Serveur est désigné par l’expression « Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le
Serveur ». Le nombre total d’Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le Serveur (et non le nombre d’utilisateurs
simultanés) ne peut pas dépasser le Nombre autorisé. A titre d’exemple, si le Client a acheté 10 licences
du Logiciel (le Nombre autorisé est 10) et qu’il choisit d’installer le Logiciel sur un Serveur, le Client ne
--- Page 166 ---
peut autoriser que 10 Utilisateurs du Logiciel sur le Serveur à accéder au Logiciel (même s’il peut y avoir
plus de 10 Utilisateurs du réseau ou moins de 10 utilisateurs simultanés du Logiciel).
2.1.7.2 Afin d’apporter davantage d’explications et sans limitations, ce qui précède n’autorise pas le
Client à installer le Logiciel ou à y accéder (que ce soit directement ou à l’aide de commandes, de
données ou d’instructions) : (a) depuis, ou à destination d’un Ordinateur ne faisant pas partie du Réseau
interne du Client ; (b) pour activer des groupes de travail ou des services hébergés sur le Web
accessibles à tous ; (c) par une personne physique ou morale non habilitée à utiliser, télécharger, copier
la fonctionnalité du Logiciel ou à en bénéficier, d’une manière quelconque, sauf sous licence d’Adobe ;
(d) en tant que composant d’un système, d’un flux de travaux ou d’un service accessible par plus
d’utilisateurs que le Nombre autorisé ou (e) pour des opérations qui ne sont pas initiées par un
utilisateur individuel (par exemple, le traitement automatisé des données sur un serveur).
2.2 Adhésion. Le présent Article 2.2 s’applique aux Clients qui ont acquis une licence ou un service
dépendants d’une adhésion tels que l’adhésion au service Creative Cloud (collectivement,
l’« Adhésion »).
2.2.1 Services en ligne d’Adobe relatifs à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent
Contrat et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client un
droit non exclusif et limité sur tout le Territoire pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel ainsi que les Services
en ligne d’Adobe connexes (conformément aux dispositions ultérieures de l’Article 16.4.1) dans le cadre
de l’Adhésion, soumis aux conditions évoquées dans le présent Contrat et aux Conditions d’utilisation
supplémentaires (telles que définies ci-dessous à l’Article 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Licence de Logiciel relative à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent Contrat
et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client une licence
non exclusive et limitée pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel : (a) sur le Territoire, (b) pendant la période
de validité et d’activation de l’Adhésion (la « Durée d’adhésion ») et (c) conformément aux conditions
du présent Contrat et à la Documentation applicable. Dès l’expiration ou la résiliation de la Durée
d’adhésion, (x) tout ou partie du Logiciel peut cesser de fonctionner sans notification préalable et (y) le
Client n’est plus autorisé à utiliser le Logiciel à moins que l’adhésion n’ait été renouvelée. Toutes les
conditions relatives au Logiciel spécifique telles qu’indiquées dans le présent Contrat restent effectives
et s’appliquent toujours au Client et à son utilisation dudit Logiciel.
2.2.3 Limitations. Le Client accepte les dispositions et les limitations supplémentaires suivantes relatives
à l’Adhésion : (a) Adobe peut modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les produits spécifiques, les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Adhésion à tout moment et
n’est en aucun cas tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications ; (b) le Client peut être
obligé de se connecter à Internet et de saisir ses informations de connexion à tout moment pendant la
Durée de l’adhésion ; (c) le Logiciel peut se connecter automatiquement à Internet afin de vérifier
l’Adhésion du Client sans notification préalable à tout moment et (d) le Client ne doit pas habiliter ou
autoriser d’autres personnes à utiliser le Logiciel en son nom.
2.3 Fichiers de contenu. Sauf dispositions contraires contenues dans les fichiers « Lisez-moi », la
Documentation ou toute autre licence associée aux Fichiers de contenu, le Client est autorisé à utiliser,
afficher à l’écran, modifier, reproduire et distribuer tous les Fichiers de contenu. Toutefois, le Client n’est
pas autorisé à distribuer les Fichiers de contenu seuls (c’est-à-dire s’ils constituent la valeur principale du
produit distribué) et n’est pas autorisé à revendiquer un droit sur une marque relative aux Fichiers de
contenu ou à toute œuvre dérivée. Aucune de ces dispositions n’affecte la propriété du Logiciel selon
l’Article 3.
2.4 Exemple de code d’application. Le Client a la possibilité de modifier le format du code source des
Logiciels qui sont expressément identifiés comme des exemples de code, exemples de code
d’application, fragments de code, fichiers de classe ActionScript ou exemples de composants (chacun

à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris
les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler ou résulter de l’usage ou de la distribution de son application.
2.5 Langages de programmation. Le Logiciel peut comprendre des parties du kit de développement
logiciel (le « SDK », « Software Development Kit ») d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender. Sous réserve des
limitations contenues dans le présent Article 2, Adobe confère au Client une licence non exclusive, non
cessible et libre de droits uniquement en vue d’utiliser les éléments du SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel
Bender dans le cadre d’activités de développement interne de programmes d’application destinés à
fonctionner avec les produits Adobe. Sauf disposition explicite contraire à l’Article 2.5, aucune autre
partie des SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender ne peut être modifiée ou distribuée. Le Client s’engage
à indemniser, à exempter de toute responsabilité et à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout
dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler
ou résulter de cette distribution.

--- Page 169 ---
5. Mises à jour.
Si le Logiciel est une Mise à jour d’une version antérieure du logiciel Adobe (« Version antérieure »),
l’utilisation de cette Mise à jour par le Client est alors soumise à la condition que celui-ci conserve la
Version antérieure. Par conséquent, si le Client transfère comme il se doit cette Mise à jour
conformément à l’Article 4.6, il doit aussi transférer la Version antérieure. Le Client ne peut utiliser cette
Mise à jour en plus de la Version antérieure que sur l’Ordinateur où il a installé et où il utilise la Version
antérieure. Toute obligation imposée à Adobe de prendre en charge les Versions antérieures pendant la
Période de validité de la licence peut se terminer dès la mise à disposition de cette Mise à jour. Toute
autre utilisation de la Mise à jour est interdite. Des Mises à jour supplémentaires, contenant des
dispositions complémentaires ou différentes, peuvent être concédées au Client sous licence par Adobe.
6. Garantie limitée.
Sauf dispositions contraires stipulées dans un contrat distinct conclu entre Adobe et un licencié du
Logiciel, Adobe garantit à la personne physique ou morale qui est la première à acheter une licence du
Logiciel afin de l’utiliser conformément aux conditions du présent contrat, que le Logiciel fonctionnera,
pour l’essentiel, conformément au manuel de l’utilisateur correspondant au Logiciel pour une période
plus courte que (a) la période de quatre-vingt-dix (90) jours ou (b) que la Période de validité de la

PAS ETRE APPLICABLE DANS CERTAINS PAYS. LE CLIENT PEUT BENEFICIER D’AUTRES DROITS DE
GARANTIE AUTORISES PAR LA LOI ET QUI NE PEUVENT PAS FAIRE L’OBJET D’UN DESISTEMENT OU
ETRE DECLINES. ADOBE N’A NULLEMENT L’INTENTION DE LIMITER LES DROITS DU CLIENT A LA
GARANTIE D’UNE FACON QUI NE SERAIT PAS AUTORISEE PAR LA LOI. Les dispositions des Articles 7

CONTRAT. Aucune disposition du présent contrat ne limite la responsabilité d’Adobe envers le Client en
cas de décès ou de préjudices corporels résultant d’une négligence de la part d’Adobe ou d’un acte
frauduleux. Adobe agit pour le compte de ses filiales, fournisseurs et Autorités de certification afin de
rejeter, d’exclure et de limiter les obligations, les garanties et les responsabilités, mais à aucun autre
égard et dans aucun autre but.
LES LIMITATIONS ET EXCLUSIONS CI-DESSUS S’APPLIQUENT DANS LA LIMITE PREVUE PAR LA LOI DU
PAYS DU CLIENT. CETTE LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITE PEUT NE PAS ETRE VALABLE DANS

tribunaux respectifs du comté de Santa Clara en Californie, lorsque s’applique la loi de l’Etat de
Californie, du Tokyo District Court au Japon, lorsque s’applique la loi du Japon, et les tribunaux
compétents de Londres en Angleterre, lorsque s’applique la loi britannique et galloise, ont chacun
compétence non exclusive en cas de litiges relatifs au présent contrat. Lorsque s’applique la loi de
Singapour, tout litige découlant du présent contrat, ou en rapport avec ce dernier, notamment toute
question quant à son existence, sa validité ou sa résiliation est définitivement réglée par arbitrage à
Singapour, conformément au Règlement d’arbitrage du Centre d’arbitrage international de Singapour
(SIAC) tant qu’il est en vigueur, dont les règles sont réputées incorporées par référence au présent
article. Un arbitre unique sera désigné d’un commun accord entre les parties. Si les parties ne
parviennent pas à s’entendre sur la désignation d’un arbitre dans les trente (30) jours suivant la
demande écrite de soumission à arbitrage par l’une d’elles, l’arbitre sera nommé par le Président du
SIAC. La langue de l’arbitrage sera l’anglais. Nonobstant toute disposition du présent contrat, Adobe ou
le Client pourra faire appel à une autorité judiciaire, administrative ou autre afin de demander une
mesure provisoire ou conservatoire, y compris une mesure d’injonction, une action spécifique ou toute
autre mesure équitable, avant l’institution de procédures légales ou d’arbitrage, ou au cours des
procédures, pour préserver les droits du Client et ses intérêts ou pour faire appliquer des dispositions
spécifiques adaptées aux recours provisoires. Ce Contrat ne sera pas régi par ce qui suit, dont
l’application est explicitement exclue par les présentes : (x) les règles en matière de conflit de lois d’un
pays, (y) la Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises et
(z) la loi UCITA (Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act), telle qu’édictée dans toute
juridiction.
11. Dispositions générales.
Si l’une quelconque des stipulations du présent contrat s’avère nulle et inopposable, la validité et
l’opposabilité des autres stipulations n’en seront pas affectées. Le présent contrat ne peut être modifié
que par un document écrit et signé par un responsable d’Adobe dûment habilité à cet effet. En ce qui
concerne l’interprétation du contrat, la version anglaise fera foi. Ce document constitue l’intégralité du
contrat conclu entre Adobe et le Client concernant le Logiciel. Il se substitue à l’ensemble des
déclarations, discussions, engagements, communications ou publicités antérieurs relatifs au Logiciel.

conformité de licence effectués par le Logiciel, à autoriser l’inspection de ses registres, systèmes et
installations par Adobe ou l’un de ses représentants agréés, pour vérifier que le Client utilise les logiciels
ou les services d’Adobe en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur, au maximum une fois tous
les douze (12) mois et dans les sept (7) jours ouvrables suivant la demande. Par exemple, Adobe a le
droit d’inspecter certains des enregistrements du Client qui seront utiles afin de déterminer si les
numéros de série ont été entrés pour les installations du Logiciel et le Client devra fournir ces
enregistrements rapidement sur demande d’Adobe. Le Client devra en outre fournir à Adobe tous les
registres et toutes les informations demandés par Adobe pour vérifier qu’il utilise les logiciels d’Adobe
en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur dans les trente (30) jours suivant toute demande
d’Adobe. Pour plus d’informations sur les numéros de série, consultez la page

14. Connectivité à Internet et confidentialité.
14.1 Connexions automatiques à Internet. Le Logiciel peut entraîner la connexion automatique de
l’Ordinateur à Internet, sans notification, ainsi que la communication avec un site Web ou un domaine
d’Adobe dans le but de valider la licence et de fournir au Client des informations supplémentaires, des
caractéristiques et des fonctionnalités. Sauf indication contraire dans les Articles 14.2 à 14.7, les
dispositions suivantes s’appliquent à toute connexion du Logiciel à Internet :
14.1.1 Lorsque le Logiciel se connecte à Internet et communique avec un site Web d’Adobe, aussi bien
automatiquement que sur requête explicite de l’utilisateur, la Charte de traitement des données
personnelles est applicable. La Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe autorise le suivi
des visites sur les sites Web et aborde en détail le sujet du suivi et l’utilisation de cookies, de pixels
invisibles et d’autres dispositifs semblables.
14.1.2 Chaque fois que le Logiciel se connecte à Adobe sur Internet, certaines informations relatives au
Client sont collectées et transmises par le Logiciel à Adobe conformément à la Charte de traitement des
données personnelles d’Adobe disponible sur http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr (la « Charte de
traitement des données personnelles »).
--- Page 173 ---
14.1.3 Si le Client accède aux Services en ligne d’Adobe (tels que définis à l’Article 16.4 ci-dessous),
active ou enregistre le Logiciel, des informations supplémentaires telles que l’identifiant Adobe, le nom
d’utilisateur et le mot de passe du Client peuvent être transmises à Adobe et stockées conformément à
la Charte de traitement des données personnelles et aux conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires
relatives auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe (collectivement avec les conditions d’utilisation
d’Adobe.com et toute condition applicable, les « Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires »).
14.1.4 Conformément à la loi en vigueur ou si le Client y consent, Adobe peut (a) envoyer au Client des
messages transactionnels visant à faciliter l’utilisation des Services en ligne d’Adobe, l’activation ou
l’enregistrement du Logiciel ou des Services en ligne d’Adobe ou (b) intégrer des supports marketing
dans le produit afin de fournir des informations sur le Logiciel et d’autres produits et Services Adobe y
compris notamment la version de la plate-forme, la version du Logiciel, l’état de la licence et la langue.
14.2 Mise à jour. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur à
Internet (par intermittence ou régulièrement) afin de (a) vérifier la disponibilité de Mises à jour à
télécharger et à installer sur l’Ordinateur du Client et (b) informer Adobe du résultat de l’installation.
14.3 Activation. Le Logiciel peut exiger que le Client (a) obtienne un identifiant Adobe, (b) active ou
réactive le Logiciel, (c) enregistre le Logiciel ou (d) valide l’Adhésion. Ces conditions peuvent entraîner
la connexion de l’Ordinateur à Internet sans notification à l’installation, au lancement et à intervalles
réguliers par la suite. Une fois connecté, le Logiciel collectera et transmettra des informations à Adobe
comme décrit en détail sur http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr (les « Conditions d’activation »). Le
Logiciel ou le Client peut recevoir des informations provenant d’Adobe relatives à la licence, à
l’inscription ou à l’Adhésion du Client. Adobe peut utiliser lesdites informations pour détecter ou
empêcher toute utilisation qui serait frauduleuse ou non autorisée et non conforme aux conditions
d’utilisation d’une licence valide, d’une inscription ou d’une Adhésion. Si le Logiciel n’est pas activé ou
enregistré, si l’inscription ou l’Adhésion n’est pas validée ou si Adobe remarque une utilisation
frauduleuse ou non autorisée du Logiciel, le Logiciel peut alors cesser de fonctionner, ses fonctionnalités
peuvent s’avérer limitées et l’inscription ou l’Adhésion peuvent être résiliées ou suspendues.
14.4 Désactivation. Le Client peut désactiver et désinstaller le Logiciel de son Ordinateur afin d’installer
ou d’activer le Logiciel sur un autre Ordinateur conformément au présent contrat (la « Désactivation »)
et de la façon décrite en détail à l’adresse http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr. La Désactivation
nécessite une connexion à Internet.
14.5 Utilisation des Services en ligne. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, par intermittence ou
régulièrement, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur du Client à Internet pour faciliter l’accès au
contenu et aux services offerts par Adobe ou des tiers comme décrit ultérieurement à l’Article 16.4
(Services en ligne). Le Logiciel peut en outre, sans avis supplémentaire, accéder à Internet pour
télécharger automatiquement des mises à jour depuis ces services en ligne pour les mettre à disposition
du Client immédiatement, même lorsque ce dernier est hors ligne.
14.6 Certificats numériques. Le Logiciel utilise des certificats numériques (tels que décrits à l’Article 16.5)
pour aider le Client à identifier les fichiers téléchargés (c’est-à-dire, les applications et leur contenu) ainsi
que les éditeurs de ces fichiers. Par exemple, Adobe AIR utilise les certificats numériques pour aider le
Client à identifier l’éditeur des applications Adobe AIR. La gamme de produits Adobe utilise également
des certificats numériques pour signer et valider les signatures dans les documents PDF (Portable
Document Format) ainsi que pour valider les documents PDF certifiés. L’Ordinateur du Client peut se
connecter à Internet au moment de la validation du certificat numérique.
14.7 Gestionnaire de configuration. Le Logiciel peut inclure Flash Player. Flash Player peut sauvegarder
certains paramètres utilisateur en les stockant sur l’Ordinateur du Client comme objet local partagé. Ils
sont associés à l’instance de Flash Player sur l’Ordinateur afin que le Client puisse personnaliser les
fonctions d’exécution. Grâce au Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player, le Client peut modifier
ces paramètres, notamment la limitation du stockage d’objets partagés locaux par des tiers ou
l’autorisation d’accès au microphone et à la caméra de l’ordinateur par du contenu tiers. Pour plus
d’informations sur la configuration des paramètres dans votre version de Flash Player, notamment sur la

désactivation des objets partagés locaux à l’aide du Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player,
reportez-vous à http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_fr. Pour plus d’informations sur les objets
partagés locaux, consultez la page http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_fr.
15. Communications poste à poste.
Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, utiliser la connexion au réseau local du Client pour se
connecter automatiquement à d’autres logiciels Adobe et peut indiquer, de ce fait, qu’il est ouvert à des
communications provenant d’autres logiciels Adobe. Ces connexions peuvent transmettre l’adresse IP
de la connexion du Client au réseau local.
16. Dispositions particulières et exceptions.
Le présent Article expose les dispositions spécifiques relatives à certains produits et composants du
Logiciel, ainsi que certaines exceptions aux dispositions ci-dessus. Si une disposition du présent Article
est en contradiction avec une autre disposition du présent contrat, les dispositions du présent Article
prévaudront.
16.1 Préjudice ; dispositions pour l’Espace économique européen ; avis obligatoire pour l’Australie.
16.1.1 Le présent contrat ne porte pas préjudice aux droits légaux de toute partie, y compris les parties
qui agissent en qualité de consommateurs. Par exemple, dans le cas de consommateurs néo-zélandais
obtenant le Logiciel pour une utilisation personnelle ou domestique (et non à des fins commerciales), le
présent contrat est soumis au Consumer Guarantees Act (Loi néo-zélandaise sur la protection des
consommateurs).
16.1.2 Si le Client a obtenu le Logiciel dans l’Espace économique européen (EEE), s’il réside dans l’EEE et
si le Client est un consommateur (c’est-à-dire s’il utilise le Logiciel à des fins personnelles non
commerciales), l’Article 6 (Garantie limitée) ne s’applique alors pas à l’achat du Logiciel effectué par le
Client ni à l’utilisation qu’il en fait. En lieu et place, Adobe garantit, pour une période de 2 ans à compter
de la date d’achat, que le Logiciel offre les fonctionnalités énoncées dans le manuel de l’utilisateur
applicable (les « Fonctionnalités convenues dans le contrat ») lorsqu’il est utilisé sur l’Ordinateur
compatible. De légères variations de performances par rapport aux Fonctionnalités convenues dans le
contrat ne sauraient donner lieu à une application de la garantie. LA PRESENTE GARANTIE NE
S’APPLIQUE PAS AUX LOGICIELS QUE LE CLIENT UTILISE EN PREVERSION, VERSION D’ESSAI, VERSION
D’APPRENTISSAGE, ECHANTILLON DE PRODUIT, OU AUX LOGICIELS DE POLICES DE CARACTERES OU
SI DES MODIFICATIONS APPORTEES AUX LOGICIELS PAR LE CLIENT ENTRAINENT L’APPARITION D’UN
DEFAUT. Pour invoquer la garantie, le Client doit avertir le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe
pendant cette période de 2 ans et fournir les détails de la preuve d’achat du Logiciel. Adobe aidera le
Client à vérifier si un défaut existe dans le Logiciel ou lui indiquera si l’erreur est due à une installation
incorrecte du Logiciel (auquel cas Adobe aidera le Client). S’il y a un défaut dans le Logiciel, le Client
peut réclamer à Adobe un remboursement, une réparation ou une copie de remplacement du Logiciel.
Toute demande doit être accompagnée d’une preuve d’achat. Dans le cas où les détails de la garantie
du Client sont vérifiés, Adobe répondra à sa demande de réparation ou de remplacement du Logiciel,
sauf si une telle demande n’est pas jugée raisonnable par Adobe, auquel cas Adobe remboursera le
Client. Veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe si vous avez besoin d’aide au sujet de
cette garantie.
Veuillez noter que les dispositions relatives à l’Article 8 (Limite de responsabilité) s’appliqueront
toujours aux réclamations pour dommage relatives à l’utilisation du Logiciel par le Client. Néanmoins,
Adobe sera responsable pour tout dommage direct raisonnablement prévisible en cas de violation du
présent contrat par Adobe. Il est conseillé au Client de prendre toutes les mesures raisonnables pour
éviter et limiter les dommages, en particulier en faisant des copies de sauvegarde du Logiciel et de ses
données informatiques.
--- Page 175 ---
Ce contrat, et en particulier le présent Article 16.1.2, est destiné à décrire les droits du Client (y compris
ses droits légaux) dans le cas où celui-ci rencontrerait des problèmes suite à son utilisation du Logiciel.
Dans le cas où ils offrent au Client une protection supérieure à cette description, les droits légaux
s’appliquent.
16.1.3 Aucune disposition dans le présent contrat (y compris l’Article 4.4) ne limite le droit inaliénable
de décompiler le Logiciel dont le Client dispose en vertu de la loi en vigueur. Par exemple, si le Client
réside dans l’Union européenne (UE), il peut avoir le droit, sous certaines conditions énoncées dans la
loi en vigueur, de décompiler le Logiciel si cela est nécessaire pour assurer l’interopérabilité du Logiciel
avec un autre programme informatique, et si le Client a demandé auparavant par écrit les informations
permettant d’accéder à cette interopérabilité à Adobe et si Adobe ne lui a pas communiqué ces
informations. En outre, la décompilation peut uniquement être effectuée par le Client ou une autre
personne autorisée à utiliser une copie du Logiciel pour le compte du Client. Adobe se réserve le droit
d’imposer des conditions raisonnables avant de fournir de telles informations. Toute information fournie
par Adobe ou obtenue par le Client, tel qu’autorisé dans les présentes, ne peut être utilisée que par le
Client aux fins spécifiées aux présentes et ne peut être communiquée à un tiers quel qu’il soit ou utilisée
pour créer un logiciel qui serait en substance similaire au Logiciel ou utilisée à toutes autres fins en
violation avec les droits d’auteur d’Adobe ou de ses concédants.
16.1.4 Si le Client obtient le Logiciel en Australie, les dispositions suivantes seront d’application,
nonobstant toute disposition contraire dans le présent Contrat :
AVIS AUX CONSOMMATEURS RÉSIDANT EN AUSTRALIE :
Nos produits sont accompagnés de garanties qui ne peuvent être exclues en vertu de la législation
applicable aux consommateurs australiens. Vous avez droit au remplacement ou au remboursement du
produit en cas de défaillance majeure et à un dédommagement pour tout autre dommage ou perte
raisonnablement prévisible. Vous pouvez également bénéficier de la réparation ou du remplacement
des produits en cas de qualité non acceptable de ceux-ci et si la défaillance n’est pas considérée comme
majeure. Nos logiciels sont également accompagnés d’une garantie limitée de 90 jours accordée par
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, dont les bureaux se situent au 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest
Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irlande, ainsi que stipulé dans le Contrat. Si vos produits ne présentent pas
les caractéristiques et fonctions générales décrites dans la Documentation utilisateur dans les 90 jours
suivant leur livraison, veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe au 1800 614 863 en
fournissant les détails du produit, le numéro de série et la preuve d’achat. Vous pourrez être invité à
renvoyer le logiciel à l’adresse que nous vous indiquerons à ce moment-là, auquel cas les frais de retour
seront à votre charge. Les avantages au titre de cette garantie viennent s’ajouter aux autres droits de
recours que pourrait vous offrir la législation.
16.2 Clauses supplémentaires concernant la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si le Logiciel est une
version commerciale préliminaire ou s’il s’agit d’un logiciel bêta (une « Version préliminaire du
Logiciel »), le présent Article s’applique. La Version préliminaire du Logiciel n’est en aucun cas la
version finale du produit d’Adobe, qui peut contenir des bogues, des erreurs et d’autres problèmes
pouvant affecter le fonctionnement du système et engendrer des pannes et des pertes de données.
Adobe peut ne jamais commercialiser la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si la Version préliminaire du
Logiciel a été fournie au Client dans le cadre d’un contrat écrit séparé, tel que le Contrat de licence
d’Adobe Systems Incorporated pour la Version préliminaire du Logiciel, l’utilisation du Logiciel est
également soumise aux conditions dudit contrat. Le Client s’engage à renvoyer ou à détruire
rapidement toutes les copies de la Version préliminaire du Logiciel à la demande d’Adobe ou lorsque
cette dernière commercialisera ledit Logiciel, selon la situation qui se présente en premier. LE CLIENT
UTILISE LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL A SES PROPRES RISQUES. VEUILLEZ VOUS
REPORTER AUX ARTICLES 6 ET 8 CONCERNANT LA GARANTIE LIMITEE ET LES LIMITATIONS DE
RESPONSABILITE RELATIVES A LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL.

16.3 Produits logiciels de formation. Si le Logiciel est un Produit logiciel de formation (logiciel fabriqué
et distribué pour être uniquement utilisé par les utilisateurs finaux de formation), le Client n’est autorisé
à utiliser le Logiciel qu’à condition d’y être habilité dans sa juridiction en qualité d’utilisateur final de
formation. Veuillez visiter la page http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_fr pour vous assurer que
votre situation répond aux conditions d’utilisation de ce Logiciel. Visitez la page
http://www.adobe.com/go/store_fr et cliquez sur le lien « Buying Adobe Products Worldwide »
(Acheter les produits Adobe dans le monde entier) afin de trouver un revendeur académique agréé par
Adobe.
16.4 Services en ligne.
16.4.1 Offerts par Adobe. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès à différents contenus et services hébergés par
des sites Web gérés par Adobe ou ses filiales (les « Services en ligne d’Adobe »). Ces Services en ligne
d’Adobe comprennent notamment : Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital
Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help et les pages d’accueil des produits. Bien qu’il se trouve
sur un site Web, un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut parfois apparaître comme une fonctionnalité ou une
extension du Logiciel. L’accès à un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut exiger du Client qu’il active le Logiciel,
obtienne un identifiant Adobe, accepte des Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires ou nécessiter un
abonnement différent afin d’accéder auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe. Les Services en ligne d’Adobe
ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays.
Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité
de tout Service en ligne d’Adobe. Adobe se réserve aussi le droit de commencer à facturer l’accès à un
Service en ligne d’Adobe préalablement gratuit. L’Article 14 mentionne des informations importantes
concernant la connectivité à Internet et la protection des données personnelles du Client. Comme décrit
à l’Article 14, lorsque le Logiciel accède à un Service en ligne d’Adobe, l’utilisation de ce Service est
régie par la Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr), par les Conditions d’utilisation d’Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_fr) et par toutes autres Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires qui
peuvent alors être présentées au Client.
16.4.2 Offerts par des tiers. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès du Client à des sites Web gérés par des tiers
proposant des produits, des informations, des logiciels et des services (« Service(s) en ligne tiers »). Ces
Services en ligne tiers incluent notamment le service Kodak EasyShare Gallery. L’accès du Client aux
Services en ligne tiers et leur utilisation sont régis par les dispositions, conditions, exclusions et
notifications disponibles sur le site en question ou associés d’une autre manière à ces Services en ligne
tiers. Adobe ne contrôle pas et ne cautionne pas les Services en ligne tiers et n’assume aucune
responsabilité vis-à-vis de ceux-ci. Toute transaction entre le Client et un tiers concernant un Service en
ligne tiers, y compris les chartes de protection des données personnelles et l’utilisation des informations
personnelles du Client par ces tiers, la livraison et le paiement de biens et de services ainsi que toutes
autres dispositions, conditions, garanties ou déclarations liées à ces transactions ne concernent que le
Client et ce tiers. Les Services en ligne tiers ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues
ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays. Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce
soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité de tout Service en ligne tiers.
16.4.3 SAUF ACCORD EXPLICITE CONTRAIRE D’ADOBE, DE SES FILIALES OU D’UN TIERS DANS UN
CONTRAT DISTINCT, LE CLIENT UTILISE LES SERVICES EN LIGNE D’ADOBE ET DE TIERS A SES PROPRES
RISQUES, CONFORMEMENT AUX LIMITATIONS DE GARANTIE ET DE RESPONSABILITE DECRITES AUX
ARTICLES 7 ET 8.
16.5 Certificats numériques.
16.5.1 Utilisation. Les certificats numériques sont délivrés par des Autorités de certification tierces, y
compris les fournisseurs d’Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) publiés sur la page
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_fr et les fournisseurs d’Adobe Approved Trust List
(AATL) publiés sur la page http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_fr (collectivement appelés « Autorités de
certification ») ou peuvent être auto-signés.
--- Page 177 ---
16.5.2 Dispositions. L’achat, l’utilisation et la fiabilité des certificats numériques sont la responsabilité du
Client et celle de l’Autorité de certification. Avant d’utiliser un document certifié, une signature
numérique ou les services d’une Autorité de certification, il est conseillé au Client de prendre
connaissance des dispositions applicables régissant les services de l’Autorité de certification, y compris,
par exemple, tout contrat d’adhésion, contrat de tiers dépendant, règlement relatif au certificat et code
déontologique. Pour plus d’informations sur les fournisseurs CDS d’Adobe, veuillez consulter le site
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_fr et, pour plus d’informations sur les fournisseurs AATL
d’Adobe, visitez le site http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_fr.
16.5.3 Accord. Le Client accepte que : (a) le Logiciel, en raison de problèmes de configuration ou
externes, peut afficher une signature comme étant valide alors que le certificat numérique a peut-être
été annulé ou a expiré avant la vérification ; (b) la sécurité ou l’intégrité d’un certificat numérique risque
d’être compromise par un acte ou une omission du signataire du document, de l’Autorité de
certification ou de tout autre tiers ; et (c) un certificat peut être un certificat personnel auto-signé qui n’a
pas été fourni par une Autorité de certification. LE CLIENT ASSUME ENTIEREMENT LA RESPONSABILITE
DE LA DECISION D’UTILISER OU NON UN CERTIFICAT. LE CLIENT UTILISE SES CERTIFICATS
NUMERIQUES A SES PROPRES RISQUES A MOINS QU’UNE GARANTIE ECRITE SEPAREE NE LUI SOIT
OFFERTE PAR UNE AUTORITE DE CERTIFICATION.
16.5.4 Tiers bénéficiaires. Le Client accepte que toute Autorité de certification soit un tiers bénéficiaire
de ce contrat et ait le droit de faire appliquer lesdites dispositions en son propre nom, au même titre
qu’Adobe.
16.5.5 Indemnité. Le Client s’engage à exonérer Adobe et toute autre autorité de certification applicable
(sauf disposition explicite contraire de ses conditions d’utilisation) de toutes responsabilités, toutes
pertes, toutes actions, tous dommages-intérêts ou toutes réclamations (y compris les dépenses, coûts et
honoraires d’avocat raisonnables) résultant de ou liés à l’utilisation par le Client de tout service d’une
Autorité de certification, y compris notamment (a) l’utilisation d’un certificat périmé ou annulé ; (b) la
vérification insuffisante d’un certificat ; (c) l’utilisation d’un certificat autre que celui autorisé par toute
disposition pertinente, par le présent contrat ou par toute loi en vigueur ; (d) le manque de
discernement raisonnable au vu des circonstances en ce qui concerne les certificats ou services de
l’émetteur ; ou (e) le non-respect des obligations telles qu’énoncées dans les dispositions liées aux
services.
16.6 Logiciels de polices de caractères. Si le Logiciel comprend un logiciel de polices de caractères :
16.6.1 Le Client peut utiliser le logiciel de polices de caractères avec le Logiciel sur des Ordinateurs,
conformément aux dispositions de l’Article 2 et générer des sorties du logiciel de polices de caractères
sur tout périphérique de sortie connecté à ces Ordinateurs.
16.6.2 Si le Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs est inférieur ou égal à cinq (5), le Client peut télécharger le
logiciel de polices de caractères dans la mémoire (disque dur ou RAM) d’un périphérique de sortie

périphérique de sortie, et d’un périphérique de sortie supplémentaire pour chaque multiple de cinq du
Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs.
16.6.3 Le Client peut donner une copie de la ou des polices de caractères qu’il a utilisées dans un fichier
donné à un imprimeur commercial ou à un autre service bureau ; ledit service bureau peut utiliser la ou
les polices de caractères pour traiter son fichier, à condition que ce service ait une licence valide pour
utiliser ledit logiciel de polices de caractères.
16.6.4 Le Client peut intégrer des copies du logiciel de polices de caractères dans ses documents
électroniques à des fins d’impression, de visualisation et d’édition du document. Aucun autre droit
d’intégration n’est concédé ni accordé en vertu de cette licence.
16.6.5 Nonobstant les dispositions précédentes, les polices répertoriées sur le site
http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_fr sont incluses dans le Logiciel uniquement en vue du
--- Page 178 ---
fonctionnement de l’interface utilisateur du Logiciel et elles ne sont pas destinées à être utilisées dans
les Fichiers de sortie. Lesdites polices ne sont pas concédées en licence tel que décrit dans le présent
Article 16.6. Le Client accepte de ne pas pouvoir copier, déplacer, activer ou utiliser, ou de n’autoriser
aucun outil de gestion de police à copier, déplacer, activer ou utiliser lesdites polices répertoriées dans
ou avec tout programme informatique, toute application ou tout fichier autre que le Logiciel.
16.7 Moteur d’affichage After Effects. Si le Logiciel comprend une version complète d’Adobe After
Effects, le Client peut alors installer un nombre illimité de Moteurs d’affichage (Render Engines) sur les
Ordinateurs du Réseau interne comprenant au moins un Ordinateur sur lequel la version complète du
logiciel Adobe After Effects est installée. L’expression « Moteur d’affichage » (Render Engine) désigne
une partie du Logiciel pouvant être installée et permettant aux projets After Effects d’être affichés ;
toutefois, cette partie du Logiciel ne peut pas être utilisée pour créer ou modifier des projets et ne
comprend pas l’interface utilisateur After Effects complète.
16.8 Fonctionnalités d’Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro et Adobe Acrobat Suite. Si le Logiciel inclut
Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, Adobe Acrobat Suite ou certaines fonctionnalités dans le Logiciel
susnommé, alors l’Article 16.8 s’applique.
16.8.1 Définitions supplémentaires.
16.8.1.1 Le terme « Déployer » signifie fournir ou mettre un Document étendu à la disposition d’un ou
de plusieurs destinataires, directement ou indirectement, par tout moyen, y compris notamment via un

Logiciel (la « Clé »). Le Client s’engage à ne pas accéder ou tenter d’accéder, contrôler, désactiver,
retirer, utiliser ou distribuer la Clé à quelque fin que ce soit.
16.8.3 Pour tout Document étendu unique, le Client est seulement autorisé à : (a) déployer ce
Document étendu vers un nombre illimité de destinataires uniques sans avoir la possibilité d’extraire ou
de provoquer l’extraction des données de plus de cinq cents (500) exemplaires uniques de ce

questionnaires remplis ; (b) déployer ce Document étendu à un nombre limité à cinq
cents (500) destinataires uniques sans limitation relative au nombre de fois que le Client peut extraire
les données dudit Document étendu qui lui est renvoyé rempli par ces destinataires. Nonobstant toute
disposition contraire des présentes, le fait d’obtenir des licences supplémentaires pour utiliser Acrobat
Standard, Acrobat Pro ou Adobe Acrobat Suite ne permet pas d’accroître le champ des limitations ci-
dessus (autrement dit, les limitations ci-dessus constituent les limites supérieures, quel que soit le
nombre de licences supplémentaires pour l’utilisation d’Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro ou Adobe
Acrobat Suite que le Client ait pu obtenir).
16.9 Projections et Moteurs d’exécution Flash Player. Le Client n’est autorisé à utiliser tout lecteur Flash

les versions d’évaluation du logiciel Adobe Contribute peuvent installer le logiciel Contribute Publishing
Services et s’y connecter conformément aux dispositions du contrat de licence d’utilisateur final de
Contribute Publishing Services.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Dans le cas où le Logiciel inclut Adobe Presenter, si le Client installe ou utilise
l’application Adobe Connect dans le cadre de l’utilisation du Logiciel, le Client s’engage à n’installer et à
n’utiliser l’application Adobe Connect que sur un ordinateur de bureau et non pas sur un équipement
autre qu’un PC, y compris notamment des périphériques Web, appareils multimédia de salon,
téléphones portables, téléphones ou tablettes WebPad. De plus, la partie du Logiciel qui est intégrée
dans une présentation, des informations ou un contenu créés et générés en utilisant le Logiciel (le
« Code d’exécution Adobe Presenter ») ne peut être utilisée qu’avec la présentation, les informations
ou le contenu auxquels elle est intégrée. Le Client n’est pas autorisé à utiliser et s’engage à faire en sorte
que les licenciés de cette présentation, ces informations ou ce contenu n’utilisent pas le Code
d’exécution Adobe Presenter autrement qu’en l’état dans lequel il est intégré dans cette présentation,
ces informations ou ce contenu. De plus, le Client n’est pas autorisé à utiliser le Code d’exécution Adobe

fds.swc pour activer des associations ou des fonctionnalités hors ligne dans un logiciel ni (b) inclure
fds.swc dans un logiciel qui soit similaire à Adobe LiveCycle Data Services ou à BlazeDS. Si telles sont les
intentions du Client, celui-ci devra demander une licence distincte à Adobe.
16.13 Digital Publishing Suite. Les dispositions suivantes s’appliquent si le Logiciel inclut certains
composants ou certaines fonctionnalités conçus pour travailler avec Digital Publishing Suite ou pour y
accéder, sous réserve des Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires relatives à Digital Publishing Suite.
L’expression « Outils de bureau DPS » désigne Folio Overlays Panel, Folio Builder Panel, Content
Viewer pour Desktop et l’extension Digital Publishing pour InDesign. Si le Logiciel inclut un Outil de
bureau DPS (ou l’un de ses composants), sauf dispositions contraires du présent Article 16 ou des
Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires, le Client ne peut alors installer et utiliser les Outils de bureau
DPS qu’à des fins (a) de création ou de production de contenu conçu pour être affiché dans Content
Viewer (« Extraction »), (b) d’évaluation et de tests de l’Extraction et (c) le cas échéant, d’accès et
d’utilisation des services d’Adobe Digital Publishing Suite conformément aux Conditions d’utilisation

2. Licence de Logiciel ; Adhésion.
2.1 Licence de Logiciel. Le présent article 2.1 s’applique uniquement aux Clients qui ont acquis une
licence pour le Logiciel mais qui n’ont pas acquis une licence ou un service dépendants d’une adhésion
tels que l’adhésion au service Creative Cloud (tel que décrit à l’article 2.2).
2.1.1 Concession de Licence. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent Contrat et du paiement
des droits d’adhésion applicables, Adobe accorde au Client une licence non exclusive et limitée pour
installer et utiliser le Logiciel (a) sur le territoire ou dans la région dans laquelle le Client a acquis le
Logiciel auprès d’Adobe ou d’un revendeur agréé par Adobe ou de toute autre manière évoquée dans
la Documentation (le « Territoire »), (b) au cours de la période de validité de ladite Licence (la
« Période de validité de la Licence »), (c) dans le cadre du Type de Licence et en fonction du Nombre
autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles du Client tel que cela est spécifié dans la Documentation et
(d) conformément aux dispositions du présent Contrat et de la Documentation applicable. Sauf mention
contraire stipulée dans le présent Contrat, la Documentation applicable ou au moment de l’achat, la
Période de validité de la Licence est perpétuelle. Dès l’expiration ou la résiliation de la Période de
validité de la Licence, tout ou partie du Logiciel peut cesser de fonctionner sans préavis. Dès l’expiration
ou la résiliation de la Période de validité de la Licence, il n’est plus possible d’utiliser le Logiciel sauf si la
licence a été renouvelée. La licence concédée dans les présentes est complétée par des dispositions
spécifiques exposées à l’Article 16 relatives à l’usage de certains produits et composants adaptés
pouvant être inclus dans le Logiciel, tels que le logiciel de polices de caractères, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite et les Moteurs
d’exécution Adobe Runtime.
2.1.2 Types de Licence.
2.1.2.1 Logiciel sans numéro de série. Le Logiciel, ou les parties du Logiciel fournies sans numéro de
série au cours de la Période de validité de la Licence peuvent être installés et utilisés sur n’importe quel
nombre d’Ordinateurs dans le cadre d’un plan de déploiement d’entreprise pendant la Période de
validité de la Licence uniquement à des fins de démonstration, d’évaluation et de formation et
seulement si les Fichiers de sortie ou autres matériels créés par ce biais sont uniquement destinés à une
utilisation interne, non commerciale et non productive. LE LOGICIEL SANS NUMERO DE SERIE EST
FOURNI « EN L’ETAT ». L’ACCES A TOUS LES FICHIERS DE SORTIE CREES AVEC LEDIT LOGICIEL SANS
NUMERO DE SERIE, DE MEME QUE LEUR UTILISATION, S’EFFECTUENT AUX PROPRES RISQUES DU
CLIENT.
2.1.2.2 Logiciels d’Evaluation. Le Logiciel, ou les parties du Logiciel, fournis avec un numéro de série et
désignés « à des fins d’évaluation » ou avec une désignation identique (telle qu’un Logiciel ou un
numéro de série fourni comme « EVAL » dans un contrat distinct) (un « Logiciel d’évaluation »)
peuvent être installés et utilisés sur un Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles pendant la Période
de validité de la Licence, uniquement à des fins de démonstration, d’évaluation et de formation, et
--- Page 183 ---
seulement si les Fichiers de sortie ou autres matériels créés par ce biais sont uniquement destinés à une
utilisation interne, non commerciale et non productive. LE LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION EST FOURNI « EN
L’ETAT ». L’ACCES A TOUS LES FICHIERS DE SORTIE CREES AVEC LEDIT LOGICIEL D’EVALUATION, DE
MEME QUE LEUR UTILISATION, S’EFFECTUENT AUX PROPRES RISQUES DU CLIENT.
2.1.2.3 Abonnement. Pour les Logiciels disponibles moyennant un abonnement (l’« Abonnement »), le
Client ne peut installer et utiliser l’abonnement que sur un Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs compatibles
pendant la Période de validité de la Licence. En fonction du Nombre autorisé d’Ordinateurs pour
l’Abonnement, Adobe peut autoriser le Client à installer et à utiliser la version antérieure la plus récente
de l’Abonnement et la version actuelle de l’Abonnement sur le même Ordinateur pendant la Période de
validité de la Licence. Le Client accepte qu’Adobe puisse modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Abonnement à tout
moment et qu’il ne soit, en aucun cas, tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications. L’accès
continu à un Abonnement requiert : (a) une connexion permanente à Internet pour activer, renouveler
et valider la Licence, (b) la réception du paiement périodique de l’Abonnement par Adobe ou ses
revendeurs agréés et (c) l’acceptation par le Client des conditions d’abonnement et des autres
dispositions et conditions supplémentaires disponibles sur http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_fr
ou au moment de l’achat. Si Adobe ne reçoit pas le paiement périodique de l’abonnement ou ne peut
pas valider la licence régulièrement, il est possible que le Logiciel soit rendu inactif sans avis préalable
jusqu’à ce qu’Adobe reçoive le paiement ou valide la licence.
2.1.3 Utilisation sur Ordinateur Portable ou Privé. Sous réserve des limitations prévues à
l’Article 2.1.4, l’utilisateur principal de l’Ordinateur sur lequel le Logiciel est installé (l’« Utilisateur
principal »), peut, dans les limites décrites à l’Article 2.1, installer une seconde copie du Logiciel
pour son utilisation personnelle exclusivement sur un Ordinateur portable ou sur un Ordinateur
privé installé à son domicile personnel, à condition que le Logiciel installé sur cet Ordinateur
portable ou privé ne soit pas en même temps utilisé sur l’Ordinateur principal.
2.1.4 Limitations relatives à l’usage secondaire par les licenciés en volume. Dans le cas où le Logiciel
aurait été obtenu par un licencié autre qu’un licencié en volume d’éducation par le biais d’un
programme ou un contrat de licence en volume Adobe (par exemple, « Achat de licences en
volume »), la seconde copie du Logiciel effectuée en application de l’Article 2.1.3 ne peut être utilisée
qu’au bénéfice et dans le cadre de l’activité dudit licencié en volume.
2.1.5 Configuration à amorçage double. Le Logiciel est sous licence pour l’utilisation sur un système
d’exploitation bien précis. Le Client doit acheter une licence distincte pour l’usage du Logiciel sur
chaque système d’exploitation. Si le Client souhaite, par exemple, installer le Logiciel sur les systèmes
d’exploitation Mac OS et Windows sur un même ordinateur qui exécute ces deux plates-formes (c’est-à-
dire, une machine à amorçage double), il doit obtenir deux licences individuelles du Logiciel. Cela
s’applique même si les deux versions du Logiciel, conçues pour différents systèmes d’exploitation, sont
fournies sur le même support.
2.1.6 Distribution via un serveur. Le Client est autorisé par la Documentation à copier une image du
Logiciel sur un serveur de fichiers informatiques du Réseau interne du Client (le « Serveur ») afin de
télécharger et d’installer le Logiciel sur d’autres Ordinateurs appartenant au même Réseau interne
uniquement dans les limites décrites au présent Article 2.
2.1.7 Utilisation du serveur.
2.1.7.1 Comme le permet un document d’achat distinct ou la Documentation et sous réserve des
limitations de la licence exposées dans le présent Contrat, le Client peut installer le Logiciel sur un
Serveur dans le seul but de permettre l’accès et l’utilisation du Logiciel à une personne à partir d’un
Ordinateur appartenant au même Réseau interne (l’« Utilisateur du réseau »). L’Utilisateur du réseau
qui a accès au dit Logiciel sur le Serveur est désigné par l’expression « Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le
Serveur ». Le nombre total d’Utilisateur du Logiciel sur le Serveur (et non le nombre d’utilisateurs
simultanés) ne peut pas dépasser le Nombre autorisé. A titre d’exemple, si le Client a acheté 10 licences
du Logiciel (le Nombre autorisé est 10) et qu’il choisit d’installer le Logiciel sur un Serveur, le Client ne
--- Page 184 ---
peut autoriser que 10 Utilisateurs du Logiciel sur le Serveur à accéder au Logiciel (même s’il peut y avoir
plus de 10 Utilisateurs du réseau ou moins de 10 utilisateurs simultanés du Logiciel).
2.1.7.2 Afin d’apporter davantage d’explications et sans limitations, ce qui précède n’autorise pas le
Client à installer le Logiciel ou à y accéder (que ce soit directement ou à l’aide de commandes, de
données ou d’instructions) : (a) depuis, ou à destination d’un Ordinateur ne faisant pas partie du Réseau
interne du Client ; (b) pour activer des groupes de travail ou des services hébergés sur le Web
accessibles à tous ; (c) par une personne physique ou morale non habilitée à utiliser, télécharger, copier
la fonctionnalité du Logiciel ou à en bénéficier, d’une manière quelconque, sauf sous licence d’Adobe ;
(d) en tant que composant d’un système, d’un flux de travaux ou d’un service accessible par plus
d’utilisateurs que le Nombre autorisé ou (e) pour des opérations qui ne sont pas initiées par un
utilisateur individuel (par exemple, le traitement automatisé des données sur un serveur).
2.2 Adhésion. Le présent Article 2.2 s’applique aux Clients qui ont acquis une licence ou un service
dépendants d’une adhésion tels que l’adhésion au service Creative Cloud (collectivement,
l’« Adhésion »).
2.2.1 Services en ligne d’Adobe relatifs à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent
Contrat et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client un
droit non exclusif et limité sur tout le Territoire pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel ainsi que les Services
en ligne d’Adobe connexes (conformément aux dispositions ultérieures de l’Article 16.4.1) dans le cadre
de l’Adhésion, soumis aux conditions évoquées dans le présent Contrat et aux Conditions d’utilisation
supplémentaires (telles que définies ci-dessous à l’Article 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Licence de Logiciel relative à l’Adhésion. Sous réserve du respect par le Client du présent Contrat
et du paiement des droits d’adhésion applicables, le cas échéant, Adobe accorde au Client une licence
non exclusive et limitée pour installer et utiliser le Logiciel : (a) sur le Territoire, (b) pendant la période
de validité et d’activation de l’Adhésion (la « Durée d’adhésion ») et (c) conformément aux conditions
du présent Contrat et à la Documentation applicable. Dès l’expiration ou la résiliation de la Durée
d’adhésion, (x) tout ou partie du Logiciel peut cesser de fonctionner sans notification préalable et (y) le
Client n’est plus autorisé à utiliser le Logiciel à moins que l’adhésion n’ait été renouvelée. Toutes les
conditions relatives au Logiciel spécifique telles qu’indiquées dans le présent Contrat restent effectives
et s’appliquent toujours au Client et à son utilisation dudit Logiciel.
2.2.3 Limitations. Le Client accepte les dispositions et les limitations supplémentaires suivantes relatives
à l’Adhésion : (a) Adobe peut modifier le type de Logiciel (par exemple : les produits spécifiques, les
composants, les versions, les plates-formes, les langues, etc.) compris dans l’Adhésion à tout moment et
n’est en aucun cas tenu responsable envers le Client desdites modifications ; (b) le Client peut être
obligé de se connecter à Internet et de saisir ses informations de connexion à tout moment pendant la
Durée de l’adhésion ; (c) le Logiciel peut se connecter automatiquement à Internet afin de vérifier
l’Adhésion du Client sans notification préalable à tout moment et (d) le Client ne doit pas habiliter ou
autoriser d’autres personnes à utiliser le Logiciel en son nom.
2.3 Fichiers de contenu. Sauf dispositions contraires contenues dans les fichiers « Lisez-moi », la
Documentation ou toute autre licence associée aux Fichiers de contenu, le Client est autorisé à utiliser,
afficher à l’écran, modifier, reproduire et distribuer tous les Fichiers de contenu. Toutefois, le Client n’est
pas autorisé à distribuer les Fichiers de contenu seuls (c’est-à-dire s’ils constituent la valeur principale du
produit distribué) et n’est pas autorisé à revendiquer un droit sur une marque relative aux Fichiers de
contenu ou à toute œuvre dérivée. Aucune de ces dispositions n’affecte la propriété du Logiciel selon
l’Article 3.
2.4 Exemple de code d’application. Le Client a la possibilité de modifier le format du code source des
Logiciels qui sont expressément identifiés comme des exemples de code, exemples de code
d’application, fragments de code, fichiers de classe ActionScript ou exemples de composants (chacun
constituant un « Exemple de code d’application ») dans la Documentation accompagnant ces derniers,
uniquement à des fins de conception, de développement et de contrôle de sites Web et d’applications
développés en utilisant des logiciels Adobe ; sous réserve de n’être autorisé à copier et à distribuer
--- Page 185 ---
l’Exemple de code d’application (modifié ou non modifié) qu’à condition de respecter l’ensemble des
conditions suivantes : (a) que le Client distribue uniquement les versions de l’objet compilé de
l’Exemple de code d’application avec son application ; (b) que le Client n’inclut pas l’Exemple de code
d’application dans un produit ou une application conçu à des fins de développement de site Web ; et
(c) qu’il n’utilise pas le nom d’Adobe, les logos, les icônes ou les autres marques d’Adobe pour
commercialiser son application. Le Client s’engage à indemniser, à exempter de toute responsabilité et
à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris
les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler ou résulter de l’usage ou de la distribution de son application.
2.5 Langages de programmation. Le Logiciel peut comprendre des parties du kit de développement
logiciel (le « SDK », « Software Development Kit ») d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender. Sous réserve des
limitations contenues dans le présent Article 2, Adobe confère au Client une licence non exclusive, non
cessible et libre de droits uniquement en vue d’utiliser les éléments du SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel
Bender dans le cadre d’activités de développement interne de programmes d’application destinés à
fonctionner avec les produits Adobe. Sauf disposition explicite contraire à l’Article 2.5, aucune autre
partie des SDK d’ExtendScript et de Pixel Bender ne peut être modifiée ou distribuée. Le Client s’engage
à indemniser, à exempter de toute responsabilité et à défendre Adobe contre toute perte, tout
dommage, toute réclamation ou action en justice, y compris les frais d’avocats qui pourraient découler
ou résulter de cette distribution.
2.6 Copies de la Documentation. Le Client est autorisé à effectuer des copies de la Documentation pour
son usage interne dans le cadre de l’utilisation du Logiciel conformément au présent contrat, dans la
limite d’un nombre raisonnablement nécessaire.
3. Titularité des droits de propriété intellectuelle.
Le Logiciel et toutes copies que le Client est autorisé à faire sont la propriété intellectuelle d’Adobe
Systems Incorporated et des fournisseurs qui les détiennent. La structure, l’organisation et le code

Systems Incorporated et de ses fournisseurs. Le Logiciel est protégé par la loi, y compris notamment par
les lois des Etats-Unis et d’autres pays sur le droit d’auteur et par les dispositions des traités
internationaux. Sauf disposition explicite contraire dans le présent contrat, celui-ci ne concède au Client
aucun droit de propriété intellectuelle sur le Logiciel. Tous les droits non expressément accordés sont
réservés par Adobe et ses fournisseurs.
4. Limitations et exigences.
4.1 Mentions de propriété. Toute copie autorisée du Logiciel (y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, de la
Documentation) que le Client effectue doit contenir les mêmes mentions de droits d’auteur et autres
droits de propriété que celles qui apparaissent sur ou dans le Logiciel.

--- Page 187 ---
5. Mises à jour.
Si le Logiciel est une Mise à jour d’une version antérieure du logiciel Adobe (« Version antérieure »),
l’utilisation de cette Mise à jour par le Client est alors soumise à la condition que celui-ci conserve la
Version antérieure. Par conséquent, si le Client transfère comme il se doit cette Mise à jour
conformément à l’Article 4.6, il doit aussi transférer la Version antérieure. Le Client ne peut utiliser cette
Mise à jour en plus de la Version antérieure que sur l’Ordinateur où il a installé et où il utilise la Version

Période de validité de la licence peut se terminer dès la mise à disposition de cette Mise à jour. Toute
autre utilisation de la Mise à jour est interdite. Des Mises à jour supplémentaires, contenant des
dispositions complémentaires ou différentes, peuvent être concédées au Client sous licence par Adobe.
6. Garantie limitée.
Sauf dispositions contraires stipulées dans un contrat distinct conclu entre Adobe et un licencié du
Logiciel, Adobe garantit à la personne physique ou morale qui est la première à acheter une licence du
Logiciel afin de l’utiliser conformément aux conditions du présent contrat, que le Logiciel fonctionnera,
pour l’essentiel, conformément au manuel de l’utilisateur correspondant au Logiciel pour une période

MANQUEMENT GRAVE OU DE MANQUEMENT A DES DISPOSITIONS ESSENTIELLES DU PRESENT
CONTRAT. Aucune disposition du présent contrat ne limite la responsabilité d’Adobe envers le Client en
cas de décès ou de préjudices corporels résultant d’une négligence de la part d’Adobe ou d’un acte
frauduleux. Adobe agit pour le compte de ses filiales, fournisseurs et Autorités de certification afin de
rejeter, d’exclure et de limiter les obligations, les garanties et les responsabilités, mais à aucun autre
égard et dans aucun autre but.
LES LIMITATIONS ET EXCLUSIONS CI-DESSUS S’APPLIQUENT DANS LA LIMITE PREVUE PAR LA LOI DU
PAYS DU CLIENT. CETTE LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITE PEUT NE PAS ETRE VALABLE DANS
CERTAINES JURIDICTIONS. LE CLIENT PEUT BENEFICIER DE DROITS QUI NE PEUVENT PAS FAIRE
L’OBJET DE DESISTEMENT EN VERTU DE LOIS DE PROTECTION DU CONSOMMATEUR ET AUTRES.
ADOBE N’A NULLEMENT L’INTENTION DE LIMITER SES DROITS A LA GARANTIE OU AUX RECOURS
D’UNE QUELCONQUE FACON QUI NE SERAIT PAS AUTORISEE PAR LA LOI. REPORTEZ-VOUS A
L’ARTICLE 16 POUR CONNAITRE LES CONDITIONS SPECIFIQUES DE VOTRE JURIDICTION.
9. Exportation.
Le Client reconnaît que le Logiciel est régi par les dispositions de l’administration américaine des
exportations (« EAR », Export Administration Regulations) auxquelles il doit se conformer. Le Client
s’engage à ne pas exporter ou réexporter le Logiciel, directement ou indirectement, vers : (a) des pays
soumis à des restrictions à l’exportation depuis les Etats-Unis (comprenant actuellement, sans s’y limiter,
Cuba, l’Iran, la Corée du Nord, le Soudan et la Syrie) ; (b) tout utilisateur final dont le Client sait ou a des
raisons de croire qu’il l’utilisera pour concevoir, développer ou produire des armes nucléaires,
chimiques ou biologiques, ou des systèmes de roquettes, des véhicules de lancement spatial et des
fusées-sondes, ou des systèmes d’avions sans pilote ; ou (c) tout utilisateur final qui s’est vu interdire par
un quelconque bureau fédéral du gouvernement américain de participer à des transactions
d’exportation depuis les Etats-Unis. Le Client est en outre tenu de se conformer aux réglementations
locales en vigueur dans sa juridiction, ce qui peut influer son droit à importer, exporter ou utiliser le
--- Page 189 ---
Logiciel. Si Adobe a connaissance qu’une violation s’est produite, Adobe peut se voir interdire d’assurer
la maintenance et l’assistance technique du Logiciel.
10. Droit applicable.
Si le Client est un consommateur utilisant le Logiciel uniquement à des fins personnelles et non
commerciales, le présent contrat est régi par les lois de la juridiction dans laquelle le Client a acheté la
licence d’utilisation du Logiciel. Si le Client n’appartient pas à cette catégorie de clientèle, le présent
contrat est régi et interprété selon les lois en vigueur : (a) dans l’Etat de Californie si le Client a obtenu
une licence du Logiciel aux Etats-Unis, au Canada ou au Mexique ; ou (b) au Japon, si le Client a obtenu
une licence du Logiciel au Japon ; ou (c) à Singapour, si le Client a obtenu une licence du Logiciel dans
un Etat membre de l’Association des Nations d’Asie du Sud-est, en Chine continentale, à Hong Kong
S.A.R., Macao S.A.R., Taiwan ou en République de Corée ; ou (d) en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles, si le
Client a obtenu une licence du Logiciel dans toute autre juridiction non mentionnée ci-dessus. Les
tribunaux respectifs du comté de Santa Clara en Californie, lorsque s’applique la loi de l’Etat de
Californie, du Tokyo District Court au Japon, lorsque s’applique la loi du Japon, et les tribunaux
compétents de Londres en Angleterre, lorsque s’applique la loi britannique et galloise, ont chacun
compétence non exclusive en cas de litiges relatifs au présent contrat. Lorsque s’applique la loi de
Singapour, tout litige découlant du présent contrat, ou en rapport avec ce dernier, notamment toute
question quant à son existence, sa validité ou sa résiliation est définitivement réglée par arbitrage à
Singapour, conformément au Règlement d’arbitrage du Centre d’arbitrage international de Singapour
(SIAC) tant qu’il est en vigueur, dont les règles sont réputées incorporées par référence au présent
article. Un arbitre unique sera désigné d’un commun accord entre les parties. Si les parties ne
parviennent pas à s’entendre sur la désignation d’un arbitre dans les trente (30) jours suivant la
demande écrite de soumission à arbitrage par l’une d’elles, l’arbitre sera nommé par le Président du
SIAC. La langue de l’arbitrage sera l’anglais. Nonobstant toute disposition du présent contrat, Adobe ou
le Client pourra faire appel à une autorité judiciaire, administrative ou autre afin de demander une
mesure provisoire ou conservatoire, y compris une mesure d’injonction, une action spécifique ou toute
autre mesure équitable, avant l’institution de procédures légales ou d’arbitrage, ou au cours des
procédures, pour préserver les droits du Client et ses intérêts ou pour faire appliquer des dispositions
spécifiques adaptées aux recours provisoires. Ce Contrat ne sera pas régi par ce qui suit, dont
l’application est explicitement exclue par les présentes : (x) les règles en matière de conflit de lois d’un
pays, (y) la Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises et
(z) la loi UCITA (Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act), telle qu’édictée dans toute
juridiction.
11. Dispositions générales.
Si l’une quelconque des stipulations du présent contrat s’avère nulle et inopposable, la validité et
l’opposabilité des autres stipulations n’en seront pas affectées. Le présent contrat ne peut être modifié
que par un document écrit et signé par un responsable d’Adobe dûment habilité à cet effet. En ce qui
concerne l’interprétation du contrat, la version anglaise fera foi. Ce document constitue l’intégralité du
contrat conclu entre Adobe et le Client concernant le Logiciel. Il se substitue à l’ensemble des
déclarations, discussions, engagements, communications ou publicités antérieurs relatifs au Logiciel.

conformément aux lois des Etats-Unis relatives aux droits d’auteur.
13. Respect des licences.
Si le Client a une activité commerciale, une société ou un organisme, il s’engage, outre les contrôles de
conformité de licence effectués par le Logiciel, à autoriser l’inspection de ses registres, systèmes et
installations par Adobe ou l’un de ses représentants agréés, pour vérifier que le Client utilise les logiciels
ou les services d’Adobe en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur, au maximum une fois tous
les douze (12) mois et dans les sept (7) jours ouvrables suivant la demande. Par exemple, Adobe a le
droit d’inspecter certains des enregistrements du Client qui seront utiles afin de déterminer si les
numéros de série ont été entrés pour les installations du Logiciel et le Client devra fournir ces
enregistrements rapidement sur demande d’Adobe. Le Client devra en outre fournir à Adobe tous les
registres et toutes les informations demandés par Adobe pour vérifier qu’il utilise les logiciels d’Adobe
en conformité avec ses licences Adobe en vigueur dans les trente (30) jours suivant toute demande
d’Adobe. Pour plus d’informations sur les numéros de série, consultez la page
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_fr.
14. Connectivité à Internet et confidentialité.
14.1 Connexions automatiques à Internet. Le Logiciel peut entraîner la connexion automatique de
l’Ordinateur à Internet, sans notification, ainsi que la communication avec un site Web ou un domaine
d’Adobe dans le but de valider la licence et de fournir au Client des informations supplémentaires, des
caractéristiques et des fonctionnalités. Sauf indication contraire dans les Articles 14.2 à 14.7, les
dispositions suivantes s’appliquent à toute connexion du Logiciel à Internet :
14.1.1 Lorsque le Logiciel se connecte à Internet et communique avec un site Web d’Adobe, aussi bien
automatiquement que sur requête explicite de l’utilisateur, la Charte de traitement des données
personnelles est applicable. La Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe autorise le suivi
des visites sur les sites Web et aborde en détail le sujet du suivi et l’utilisation de cookies, de pixels
invisibles et d’autres dispositifs semblables.
14.1.2 Chaque fois que le Logiciel se connecte à Adobe sur Internet, certaines informations relatives au
Client sont collectées et transmises par le Logiciel à Adobe conformément à la Charte de traitement des
données personnelles d’Adobe disponible sur http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr (la « Charte de
traitement des données personnelles »).
--- Page 191 ---
14.1.3 Si le Client accède aux Services en ligne d’Adobe (tels que définis à l’Article 16.4 ci-dessous),
active ou enregistre le Logiciel, des informations supplémentaires telles que l’identifiant Adobe, le nom
d’utilisateur et le mot de passe du Client peuvent être transmises à Adobe et stockées conformément à
la Charte de traitement des données personnelles et aux conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires
relatives auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe (collectivement avec les conditions d’utilisation
d’Adobe.com et toute condition applicable, les « Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires »).
14.1.4 Conformément à la loi en vigueur ou si le Client y consent, Adobe peut (a) envoyer au Client des
messages transactionnels visant à faciliter l’utilisation des Services en ligne d’Adobe, l’activation ou
l’enregistrement du Logiciel ou des Services en ligne d’Adobe ou (b) intégrer des supports marketing
dans le produit afin de fournir des informations sur le Logiciel et d’autres produits et Services Adobe y
compris notamment la version de la plate-forme, la version du Logiciel, l’état de la licence et la langue.
14.2 Mise à jour. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur à
Internet (par intermittence ou régulièrement) afin de (a) vérifier la disponibilité de Mises à jour à
télécharger et à installer sur l’Ordinateur du Client et (b) informer Adobe du résultat de l’installation.
14.3 Activation. Le Logiciel peut exiger que le Client (a) obtienne un identifiant Adobe, (b) active ou
réactive le Logiciel, (c) enregistre le Logiciel ou (d) valide l’Adhésion. Ces conditions peuvent entraîner
la connexion de l’Ordinateur à Internet sans notification à l’installation, au lancement et à intervalles
réguliers par la suite. Une fois connecté, le Logiciel collectera et transmettra des informations à Adobe
comme décrit en détail sur http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr (les « Conditions d’activation »). Le
Logiciel ou le Client peut recevoir des informations provenant d’Adobe relatives à la licence, à
l’inscription ou à l’Adhésion du Client. Adobe peut utiliser lesdites informations pour détecter ou
empêcher toute utilisation qui serait frauduleuse ou non autorisée et non conforme aux conditions
d’utilisation d’une licence valide, d’une inscription ou d’une Adhésion. Si le Logiciel n’est pas activé ou
enregistré, si l’inscription ou l’Adhésion n’est pas validée ou si Adobe remarque une utilisation
frauduleuse ou non autorisée du Logiciel, le Logiciel peut alors cesser de fonctionner, ses fonctionnalités
peuvent s’avérer limitées et l’inscription ou l’Adhésion peuvent être résiliées ou suspendues.
14.4 Désactivation. Le Client peut désactiver et désinstaller le Logiciel de son Ordinateur afin d’installer
ou d’activer le Logiciel sur un autre Ordinateur conformément au présent contrat (la « Désactivation »)
et de la façon décrite en détail à l’adresse http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_fr. La Désactivation
nécessite une connexion à Internet.
14.5 Utilisation des Services en ligne. Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, par intermittence ou
régulièrement, connecter automatiquement l’Ordinateur du Client à Internet pour faciliter l’accès au
contenu et aux services offerts par Adobe ou des tiers comme décrit ultérieurement à l’Article 16.4
(Services en ligne). Le Logiciel peut en outre, sans avis supplémentaire, accéder à Internet pour
télécharger automatiquement des mises à jour depuis ces services en ligne pour les mettre à disposition
du Client immédiatement, même lorsque ce dernier est hors ligne.
14.6 Certificats numériques. Le Logiciel utilise des certificats numériques (tels que décrits à l’Article 16.5)
pour aider le Client à identifier les fichiers téléchargés (c’est-à-dire, les applications et leur contenu) ainsi
que les éditeurs de ces fichiers. Par exemple, Adobe AIR utilise les certificats numériques pour aider le
Client à identifier l’éditeur des applications Adobe AIR. La gamme de produits Adobe utilise également
des certificats numériques pour signer et valider les signatures dans les documents PDF (Portable
Document Format) ainsi que pour valider les documents PDF certifiés. L’Ordinateur du Client peut se
connecter à Internet au moment de la validation du certificat numérique.
14.7 Gestionnaire de configuration. Le Logiciel peut inclure Flash Player. Flash Player peut sauvegarder
certains paramètres utilisateur en les stockant sur l’Ordinateur du Client comme objet local partagé. Ils
sont associés à l’instance de Flash Player sur l’Ordinateur afin que le Client puisse personnaliser les
fonctions d’exécution. Grâce au Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player, le Client peut modifier
ces paramètres, notamment la limitation du stockage d’objets partagés locaux par des tiers ou
l’autorisation d’accès au microphone et à la caméra de l’ordinateur par du contenu tiers. Pour plus
d’informations sur la configuration des paramètres dans votre version de Flash Player, notamment sur la
--- Page 192 ---
désactivation des objets partagés locaux à l’aide du Gestionnaire de configuration de Flash Player,
reportez-vous à http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_fr. Pour plus d’informations sur les objets
partagés locaux, consultez la page http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_fr.
15. Communications poste à poste.
Le Logiciel peut, sans avis supplémentaire, utiliser la connexion au réseau local du Client pour se
connecter automatiquement à d’autres logiciels Adobe et peut indiquer, de ce fait, qu’il est ouvert à des
communications provenant d’autres logiciels Adobe. Ces connexions peuvent transmettre l’adresse IP
de la connexion du Client au réseau local.
16. Dispositions particulières et exceptions.
Le présent Article expose les dispositions spécifiques relatives à certains produits et composants du
Logiciel, ainsi que certaines exceptions aux dispositions ci-dessus. Si une disposition du présent Article
est en contradiction avec une autre disposition du présent contrat, les dispositions du présent Article
prévaudront.
16.1 Préjudice ; dispositions pour l’Espace économique européen ; avis obligatoire pour l’Australie.
16.1.1 Le présent contrat ne porte pas préjudice aux droits légaux de toute partie, y compris les parties
qui agissent en qualité de consommateurs. Par exemple, dans le cas de consommateurs néo-zélandais
obtenant le Logiciel pour une utilisation personnelle ou domestique (et non à des fins commerciales), le
présent contrat est soumis au Consumer Guarantees Act (Loi néo-zélandaise sur la protection des
consommateurs).
16.1.2 Si le Client a obtenu le Logiciel dans l’Espace économique européen (EEE), s’il réside dans l’EEE et
si le Client est un consommateur (c’est-à-dire s’il utilise le Logiciel à des fins personnelles non
commerciales), l’Article 6 (Garantie limitée) ne s’applique alors pas à l’achat du Logiciel effectué par le
Client ni à l’utilisation qu’il en fait. En lieu et place, Adobe garantit, pour une période de 2 ans à compter
de la date d’achat, que le Logiciel offre les fonctionnalités énoncées dans le manuel de l’utilisateur
applicable (les « Fonctionnalités convenues dans le contrat ») lorsqu’il est utilisé sur l’Ordinateur
compatible. De légères variations de performances par rapport aux Fonctionnalités convenues dans le
contrat ne sauraient donner lieu à une application de la garantie. LA PRESENTE GARANTIE NE
S’APPLIQUE PAS AUX LOGICIELS QUE LE CLIENT UTILISE EN PREVERSION, VERSION D’ESSAI, VERSION
D’APPRENTISSAGE, ECHANTILLON DE PRODUIT, OU AUX LOGICIELS DE POLICES DE CARACTERES OU
SI DES MODIFICATIONS APPORTEES AUX LOGICIELS PAR LE CLIENT ENTRAINENT L’APPARITION D’UN
DEFAUT. Pour invoquer la garantie, le Client doit avertir le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe
pendant cette période de 2 ans et fournir les détails de la preuve d’achat du Logiciel. Adobe aidera le
Client à vérifier si un défaut existe dans le Logiciel ou lui indiquera si l’erreur est due à une installation
incorrecte du Logiciel (auquel cas Adobe aidera le Client). S’il y a un défaut dans le Logiciel, le Client
peut réclamer à Adobe un remboursement, une réparation ou une copie de remplacement du Logiciel.
Toute demande doit être accompagnée d’une preuve d’achat. Dans le cas où les détails de la garantie
du Client sont vérifiés, Adobe répondra à sa demande de réparation ou de remplacement du Logiciel,
sauf si une telle demande n’est pas jugée raisonnable par Adobe, auquel cas Adobe remboursera le
Client. Veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe si vous avez besoin d’aide au sujet de
cette garantie.
Veuillez noter que les dispositions relatives à l’Article 8 (Limite de responsabilité) s’appliqueront
toujours aux réclamations pour dommage relatives à l’utilisation du Logiciel par le Client. Néanmoins,
Adobe sera responsable pour tout dommage direct raisonnablement prévisible en cas de violation du
présent contrat par Adobe. Il est conseillé au Client de prendre toutes les mesures raisonnables pour
éviter et limiter les dommages, en particulier en faisant des copies de sauvegarde du Logiciel et de ses
données informatiques.
--- Page 193 ---
Ce contrat, et en particulier le présent Article 16.1.2, est destiné à décrire les droits du Client (y compris
ses droits légaux) dans le cas où celui-ci rencontrerait des problèmes suite à son utilisation du Logiciel.
Dans le cas où ils offrent au Client une protection supérieure à cette description, les droits légaux
s’appliquent.
16.1.3 Aucune disposition dans le présent contrat (y compris l’Article 4.4) ne limite le droit inaliénable
de décompiler le Logiciel dont le Client dispose en vertu de la loi en vigueur. Par exemple, si le Client
réside dans l’Union européenne (UE), il peut avoir le droit, sous certaines conditions énoncées dans la
loi en vigueur, de décompiler le Logiciel si cela est nécessaire pour assurer l’interopérabilité du Logiciel
avec un autre programme informatique, et si le Client a demandé auparavant par écrit les informations
permettant d’accéder à cette interopérabilité à Adobe et si Adobe ne lui a pas communiqué ces
informations. En outre, la décompilation peut uniquement être effectuée par le Client ou une autre
personne autorisée à utiliser une copie du Logiciel pour le compte du Client. Adobe se réserve le droit
d’imposer des conditions raisonnables avant de fournir de telles informations. Toute information fournie
par Adobe ou obtenue par le Client, tel qu’autorisé dans les présentes, ne peut être utilisée que par le
Client aux fins spécifiées aux présentes et ne peut être communiquée à un tiers quel qu’il soit ou utilisée
pour créer un logiciel qui serait en substance similaire au Logiciel ou utilisée à toutes autres fins en
violation avec les droits d’auteur d’Adobe ou de ses concédants.
16.1.4 Si le Client obtient le Logiciel en Australie, les dispositions suivantes seront d’application,
nonobstant toute disposition contraire dans le présent Contrat :
AVIS AUX CONSOMMATEURS RÉSIDANT EN AUSTRALIE :
Nos produits sont accompagnés de garanties qui ne peuvent être exclues en vertu de la législation
applicable aux consommateurs australiens. Vous avez droit au remplacement ou au remboursement du
produit en cas de défaillance majeure et à un dédommagement pour tout autre dommage ou perte
raisonnablement prévisible. Vous pouvez également bénéficier de la réparation ou du remplacement
des produits en cas de qualité non acceptable de ceux-ci et si la défaillance n’est pas considérée comme
majeure. Nos logiciels sont également accompagnés d’une garantie limitée de 90 jours accordée par
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, dont les bureaux se situent au 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest
Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irlande, ainsi que stipulé dans le Contrat. Si vos produits ne présentent pas
les caractéristiques et fonctions générales décrites dans la Documentation utilisateur dans les 90 jours
suivant leur livraison, veuillez contacter le service d’assistance clientèle d’Adobe au 1800 614 863 en
fournissant les détails du produit, le numéro de série et la preuve d’achat. Vous pourrez être invité à
renvoyer le logiciel à l’adresse que nous vous indiquerons à ce moment-là, auquel cas les frais de retour
seront à votre charge. Les avantages au titre de cette garantie viennent s’ajouter aux autres droits de
recours que pourrait vous offrir la législation.
16.2 Clauses supplémentaires concernant la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si le Logiciel est une
version commerciale préliminaire ou s’il s’agit d’un logiciel bêta (une « Version préliminaire du
Logiciel »), le présent Article s’applique. La Version préliminaire du Logiciel n’est en aucun cas la
version finale du produit d’Adobe, qui peut contenir des bogues, des erreurs et d’autres problèmes
pouvant affecter le fonctionnement du système et engendrer des pannes et des pertes de données.
Adobe peut ne jamais commercialiser la Version préliminaire du Logiciel. Si la Version préliminaire du
Logiciel a été fournie au Client dans le cadre d’un contrat écrit séparé, tel que le Contrat de licence
d’Adobe Systems Incorporated pour la Version préliminaire du Logiciel, l’utilisation du Logiciel est
également soumise aux conditions dudit contrat. Le Client s’engage à renvoyer ou à détruire
rapidement toutes les copies de la Version préliminaire du Logiciel à la demande d’Adobe ou lorsque
cette dernière commercialisera ledit Logiciel, selon la situation qui se présente en premier. LE CLIENT
UTILISE LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL A SES PROPRES RISQUES. VEUILLEZ VOUS
REPORTER AUX ARTICLES 6 ET 8 CONCERNANT LA GARANTIE LIMITEE ET LES LIMITATIONS DE
RESPONSABILITE RELATIVES A LA VERSION PRELIMINAIRE DU LOGICIEL.

16.4 Services en ligne.
16.4.1 Offerts par Adobe. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès à différents contenus et services hébergés par
des sites Web gérés par Adobe ou ses filiales (les « Services en ligne d’Adobe »). Ces Services en ligne
d’Adobe comprennent notamment : Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital
Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help et les pages d’accueil des produits. Bien qu’il se trouve
sur un site Web, un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut parfois apparaître comme une fonctionnalité ou une
extension du Logiciel. L’accès à un Service en ligne d’Adobe peut exiger du Client qu’il active le Logiciel,
obtienne un identifiant Adobe, accepte des Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires ou nécessiter un
abonnement différent afin d’accéder auxdits Services en ligne d’Adobe. Les Services en ligne d’Adobe
ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays.
Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité
de tout Service en ligne d’Adobe. Adobe se réserve aussi le droit de commencer à facturer l’accès à un
Service en ligne d’Adobe préalablement gratuit. L’Article 14 mentionne des informations importantes
concernant la connectivité à Internet et la protection des données personnelles du Client. Comme décrit
à l’Article 14, lorsque le Logiciel accède à un Service en ligne d’Adobe, l’utilisation de ce Service est
régie par la Charte de traitement des données personnelles d’Adobe
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_fr), par les Conditions d’utilisation d’Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_fr) et par toutes autres Conditions d’utilisation supplémentaires qui
peuvent alors être présentées au Client.
16.4.2 Offerts par des tiers. Le Logiciel peut faciliter l’accès du Client à des sites Web gérés par des tiers
proposant des produits, des informations, des logiciels et des services (« Service(s) en ligne tiers »). Ces
Services en ligne tiers incluent notamment le service Kodak EasyShare Gallery. L’accès du Client aux
Services en ligne tiers et leur utilisation sont régis par les dispositions, conditions, exclusions et
notifications disponibles sur le site en question ou associés d’une autre manière à ces Services en ligne
tiers. Adobe ne contrôle pas et ne cautionne pas les Services en ligne tiers et n’assume aucune
responsabilité vis-à-vis de ceux-ci. Toute transaction entre le Client et un tiers concernant un Service en
ligne tiers, y compris les chartes de protection des données personnelles et l’utilisation des informations
personnelles du Client par ces tiers, la livraison et le paiement de biens et de services ainsi que toutes
autres dispositions, conditions, garanties ou déclarations liées à ces transactions ne concernent que le
Client et ce tiers. Les Services en ligne tiers ne sont pas forcément disponibles dans toutes les langues
ou accessibles aux résidents de tous les pays. Adobe peut, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce
soit, modifier ou suspendre la disponibilité de tout Service en ligne tiers.
16.4.3 SAUF ACCORD EXPLICITE CONTRAIRE D’ADOBE, DE SES FILIALES OU D’UN TIERS DANS UN
CONTRAT DISTINCT, LE CLIENT UTILISE LES SERVICES EN LIGNE D’ADOBE ET DE TIERS A SES PROPRES
RISQUES, CONFORMEMENT AUX LIMITATIONS DE GARANTIE ET DE RESPONSABILITE DECRITES AUX
ARTICLES 7 ET 8.
16.5 Certificats numériques.
16.5.1 Utilisation. Les certificats numériques sont délivrés par des Autorités de certification tierces, y
compris les fournisseurs d’Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) publiés sur la page

certification ») ou peuvent être auto-signés.
--- Page 195 ---
16.5.2 Dispositions. L’achat, l’utilisation et la fiabilité des certificats numériques sont la responsabilité du
Client et celle de l’Autorité de certification. Avant d’utiliser un document certifié, une signature
numérique ou les services d’une Autorité de certification, il est conseillé au Client de prendre
connaissance des dispositions applicables régissant les services de l’Autorité de certification, y compris,
par exemple, tout contrat d’adhésion, contrat de tiers dépendant, règlement relatif au certificat et code
déontologique. Pour plus d’informations sur les fournisseurs CDS d’Adobe, veuillez consulter le site

16.5.3 Accord. Le Client accepte que : (a) le Logiciel, en raison de problèmes de configuration ou
externes, peut afficher une signature comme étant valide alors que le certificat numérique a peut-être
été annulé ou a expiré avant la vérification ; (b) la sécurité ou l’intégrité d’un certificat numérique risque
d’être compromise par un acte ou une omission du signataire du document, de l’Autorité de
certification ou de tout autre tiers ; et (c) un certificat peut être un certificat personnel auto-signé qui n’a
pas été fourni par une Autorité de certification. LE CLIENT ASSUME ENTIEREMENT LA RESPONSABILITE
DE LA DECISION D’UTILISER OU NON UN CERTIFICAT. LE CLIENT UTILISE SES CERTIFICATS
NUMERIQUES A SES PROPRES RISQUES A MOINS QU’UNE GARANTIE ECRITE SEPAREE NE LUI SOIT
OFFERTE PAR UNE AUTORITE DE CERTIFICATION.

(sauf disposition explicite contraire de ses conditions d’utilisation) de toutes responsabilités, toutes
pertes, toutes actions, tous dommages-intérêts ou toutes réclamations (y compris les dépenses, coûts et
honoraires d’avocat raisonnables) résultant de ou liés à l’utilisation par le Client de tout service d’une
Autorité de certification, y compris notamment (a) l’utilisation d’un certificat périmé ou annulé ; (b) la
vérification insuffisante d’un certificat ; (c) l’utilisation d’un certificat autre que celui autorisé par toute
disposition pertinente, par le présent contrat ou par toute loi en vigueur ; (d) le manque de
discernement raisonnable au vu des circonstances en ce qui concerne les certificats ou services de
l’émetteur ; ou (e) le non-respect des obligations telles qu’énoncées dans les dispositions liées aux
services.

kompatibler Computer während der Lizenzlaufzeit installieren und verwenden. Vorbehaltlich der
zulässigen Anzahl von Computern für die Abonnementversion kann Adobe dem Kunden gestatten, die
letzte vorherige Abonnementversion und die aktuelle Abonnementversion während der Laufzeit auf
demselben Computer zu installieren und zu verwenden. Der Kunde erklärt sich damit einverstanden,
dass Adobe den Softwaretyp (wie spezielle Komponenten, Versionen, Plattformen, Sprachen usw.), der
in der Abonnementversion enthalten ist, jederzeit ändern kann und dem Kunden gegenüber für eine
derartige Änderung keinerlei Haftung übernimmt. Für den laufenden Zugriff auf eine
Abonnementversion ist Folgendes erforderlich: (a) eine wiederkehrende Internetverbindung zur
Aktivierung, Erneuerung und Validierung der Lizenz, (b) wiederkehrende Bezahlung der
Abonnementgebühren an Adobe oder ihre autorisierten Fachhändler und (c) Annahme der
Abonnementbedingungen und Zusatzbestimmungen, die unter

entsprechenden Volumenlizenznehmers genutzt werden.
2.1.5 Dualboot-Plattform. Die Software ist zur Verwendung auf einer bestimmten
Betriebssystemplattform lizenziert. Der Kunde muss für die Verwendung der Software auf jeder
einzelnen Betriebssystemplattform eine eigene Lizenz erwerben. Wenn der Kunde die Software
beispielsweise auf der Mac OS- und Windows-Betriebssystemplattform auf einem Gerät installieren
möchte, auf dem diese beiden Plattformen ausgeführt werden (d. h. auf einem Dualboot-Rechner),
muss er zwei Lizenzen für die Software erwerben. Dies ist auch dann der Fall, wenn zwei Versionen der
Software für jeweils eine andere Betriebssystemplattform auf demselben Datenträger geliefert werden.
--- Page 202 ---
2.1.6 Verbreitung von einem Server. Der Kunde darf, wie laut Dokumentation gestattet, ein Abbild der
Software auf einen Dateiserver innerhalb des internen Netzwerks des Kunden kopieren („Server“), um
die Software auf Computer innerhalb des gleichen internen Netzwerks zur Verwendung gemäß Ziffer 2
herunterzuladen und auf diesen zu installieren.
2.1.7 Serververwendung.
2.1.7.1 Wie laut separatem Bestelldokument oder Dokumentation gestattet und vorbehaltlich der
Lizenzbeschränkungen gemäß diesem Vertrag kann der Kunde die Software auf einem Server
ausschließlich zu dem Zweck installieren, um einer Einzelperson von einem Computer in demselben
internen Netzwerk („Netzwerkbenutzer“) den Zugriff auf die Software und deren Verwendung zu
ermöglichen. Der Netzwerkbenutzer, der auf dem Server Zugang zu derartiger Software hat, wird als
„Serversoftwarebenutzer“ bezeichnet. Die gesamte Anzahl der Serversoftwarebenutzer (nicht die Anzahl
der gleichzeitigen Benutzer) darf die zulässige Anzahl nicht übersteigen. Wenn der Kunde
beispielsweise 10 Softwarelizenzen erworben hat (die zulässige Anzahl ist 10) und die Software auf
einem Server installiert, darf der Kunde nur bis zu 10 Serversoftwarebenutzern den Zugang zur Software
gestatten (auch wenn der Kunde mehr als 10 Netzwerkbenutzer oder weniger als 10 gleichzeitige
Benutzer der Software hat).
2.1.7.2 Zur Klarstellung wird ohne Einschränkung darauf hingewiesen, dass die vorstehenden
Bestimmungen es dem Kunden nicht gestatten, die Software wie folgt zu installieren oder auf die
Software (direkt oder über Befehle, Daten oder Anweisungen) zuzugreifen: (a) von oder an einem
anderen Computer, der nicht Teil des internen Netzwerks des Kunden ist, (b) zur Ermöglichung von
Web-Hosted-Dienstleistungen oder öffentlich zugänglichen Web-Hosted-Dienstleistungen, (c) durch
eine natürliche oder juristische Person, die zur Verwendung, zum Herunterladen, zur Vervielfältigung
oder zur anderweitigen Nutzung der Funktionen der Software nicht durch eine gültige Lizenz von Adobe
berechtigt ist, (d) als Komponente von Systemen, Ablaufplänen oder Diensten, die mehr als der
zulässigen Anzahl von Benutzern zugänglich ist, oder (e) für Tätigkeiten, die nicht durch einen
Einzelbenutzer initiiert werden (z. B. automatische Serververarbeitung).
2.2 Mitgliedschaft. Diese Ziffer 2.2 gilt für Kunden, die eine auf Mitgliedschaft beruhende Lizenz oder
Dienstleistung wie z. B. eine Creative Cloud-Mitgliedschaft erworben haben (gemeinsam als
„Mitgliedschaft“ bezeichnet).
2.2.1 Online-Dienste von Adobe im Zusammenhang mit der Mitgliedschaft. Vorbehaltlich der ständigen
Einhaltung dieses Vertrags und gegebenenfalls der Bezahlung der entsprechenden
Mitgliedschaftsgebühren durch den Kunden gewährt Adobe dem Kunden das nicht ausschließliche und
beschränkte Recht, vorbehaltlich der Bestimmungen dieses Vertrags und der zusätzlichen
Nutzungsbedingungen (siehe Definition in Ziffer 14.1.3 weiter unten) auf die Software und den
zugehörigen Online-Dienst von Adobe (siehe Beschreibung in Ziffer 16.4.1) im Zuge der Mitgliedschaft
im Vertragsgebiet zuzugreifen und diese zu nutzen.
2.2.2 Softwarelizenz im Zusammenhang mit Mitgliedschaft. Vorbehaltlich der ständigen Einhaltung
dieses Vertrags und gegebenenfalls der Bezahlung der entsprechenden Mitgliedschaftsgebühren durch
den Kunden gewährt Adobe dem Kunden das nicht ausschließliche und beschränkte Recht, die
Software (a) im Vertragsgebiet, (b) während des Zeitraums, in dem die Mitgliedschaft aktuell und aktiv
ist („Laufzeit der Mitgliedschaft“), und (c) gemäß den Bestimmungen dieses Vertrags und der
zugehörigen Dokumentation zu installieren und zu verwenden. Bei Ablauf oder Kündigung der
Mitgliedschaft (x) kann die Software ohne vorherige Ankündigung ganz oder teilweise nicht mehr
funktionsfähig sein und (y) darf der Kunde die Software nicht mehr verwenden, es sei denn, er hat die
Mitgliedschaft verlängert. Alle Bestimmungen, die wie in diesem Vertrag festgelegt für die jeweilige
Software gelten, bleiben auch weiterhin für den Kunden und die Verwendung derartiger Software durch
den Kunden in Kraft.
2.2.3 Beschränkungen. Der Kunde erklärt sich mit den folgenden zusätzlichen Bedingungen und
Beschränkungen im Zusammenhang mit der Mitgliedschaft einverstanden: (a) Adobe kann den
Softwaretyp (wie spezielle Produkte, Komponenten, Versionen, Plattformen, Sprachen usw.), den die
--- Page 203 ---
Mitgliedschaft umfasst, jederzeit ändern und übernimmt dem Kunden gegenüber für eine derartige
Änderung keinerlei Haftung, (b) es kann während der Laufzeit der Mitgliedschaft jederzeit erforderlich
sein, dass der Kunde eine Verbindung zum Internet herstellen und sich anmelden muss, (c) die Software
kann jederzeit ohne Benachrichtigung automatisch eine Verbindung zum Internet herstellen, um die
Mitgliedschaft des Kunden zu überprüfen, und (d) der Kunde darf anderen nicht ermöglichen oder
erlauben, die Software als Kunde zu verwenden.
2.3 Inhaltsdateien. Unbeschadet anderslautender Bestimmungen in den „Read me“-Dateien, der
Dokumentation oder anderen Lizenzen im Zusammenhang mit den Inhaltsdateien darf der Kunde alle
Inhaltsdateien verwenden, anzeigen, ändern, vervielfältigen und verteilen. Der Kunde darf die
Inhaltsdateien allerdings nicht einzeln vertreiben (d. h. in Fällen, in denen diese den eigentlichen Wert
des vertriebenen Produkts ausmachen), und der Kunde hat keinen Anspruch auf Markenrechte
hinsichtlich Inhaltsdateien oder Ableitungen davon. Keine hierin enthaltene Bestimmung hat
Auswirkungen auf die Eigentumsrechte an der Software laut Ziffer 3.
2.4 Beispiel-Anwendungscode. Der Kunde darf den Quellcode jener Teile des Softwareprogramms, die
in der Begleitdokumentation ausdrücklich als Beispielcode, Beispiel-Anwendungscode,
Codeausschnitte, ActionScript-Klassendateien oder Musterkomponenten (einzeln jeweils „Beispiel-
Anwendungscode“) ausgewiesen sind, ausschließlich zwecks Entwurf, Entwicklung und Erprobung von
mit Hilfe von Adobe-Softwareprogrammen entwickelten Websites und Anwendungen ändern. Der
Beispiel-Anwendungscode (gleich ob verändert oder nicht) darf jedoch nur kopiert und vertrieben
werden, wenn alle nachstehend genannten Bedingungen erfüllt sind: (a) Der Kunde vertreibt nur den
kompilierten Beispiel-Anwendungscode in Objektcode-Form zusammen mit seiner Anwendung, (b) der
Kunde integriert den Musteranwendungscode nicht in für die Entwicklung von Websites bestimmte
Produkte oder Anwendungen und (c) der Kunde verwendet zur Vermarktung seiner Anwendung keine
Namen, Logos, Symbole oder anderen Marken von Adobe. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, Adobe von

mögliche Klagen zu verteidigen, die sich aus der Nutzung oder dem Vertrieb seiner Anwendung
ergeben.
2.5 Programmiersprachen. Die Software kann Teile des ExtendScript SDK und Pixel Bender SDK
umfassen. Gemäß den Einschränkungen laut Ziffer 2 gewährt Adobe dem Kunden eine nicht
ausschließliche, nicht übertragbare und kostenlose Lizenz zur Verwendung der Komponenten des
ExtendScript SDK und Pixel Bender SDK ausschließlich zur internen Entwicklung von
Anwendungsprogrammen, die zur Nutzung mit Produkten von Adobe konzipiert sind. Außer wie in
Ziffer 2.5 ausdrücklich festgelegt, dürfen keine Teile des ExtendScript SDK oder Pixel Bender SDK
geändert oder vertrieben werden. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, Adobe von allen Verlusten, Schäden und
Ansprüchen einschließlich Anwaltskosten freizustellen bzw. Adobe gegen mögliche Klagen zu
verteidigen, die sich aus einem derartigen Vertrieb ergeben.
2.6 Kopien der Dokumentation. Der Kunde ist berechtigt, eine angemessene Anzahl von Kopien der
Dokumentation zur internen Verwendung im Zusammenhang mit der vertragsgemäßen Nutzung der
Software anzufertigen.
3. Rechte an geistigem Eigentum.

4. Einschränkungen und Bedingungen.
4.1 Schutzrechtliche Vermerke. Jede zulässige Kopie der Software (einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt
auf Dokumentation), die der Kunde anfertigt, muss dieselben Urheberrechts- und Schutzrechtsvermerke
tragen, die auch auf oder in der Software selbst enthalten sind.
4.2 Verwendungsbedingungen. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, die Software nur auf die gemäß diesem
Vertrag zulässige Art und nicht auf eine Weise zu verwenden, die nicht der Konzeption oder

dem Kunden so überlassen. Sie darf nur als einzelnes Produkt auf Computern, wie hierin gestattet,
verwendet werden. Vorbehaltlich anderslautender Bestimmungen in der Dokumentation ist der Kunde
nicht verpflichtet, sämtliche Teile der Software zu installieren. Der Kunde darf jedoch nicht einzelne
Komponenten der Software von den übrigen Teilen der Software zur Nutzung auf verschiedenen
Computern trennen.
4.6 Keine Übertragung.
4.6.1 DER KUNDE DARF SEINE RECHTE AN DER SOFTWARE (EINSCHLIESSLICH, ABER NICHT
BESCHRÄNKT AUF SOFTWARE, DIE AUS DEM INTERNET HERUNTERGELADEN WURDE) NICHT
VERMIETEN, VERLEIHEN, VERKAUFEN, UNTERLIZENZIEREN, ABTRETEN ODER ÜBERTRAGEN, ODER
DAS KOPIEREN DER SOFTWARE WEDER IN TEILEN NOCH ALS GANZES AUF DEN COMPUTER EINES
ANDEREN BENUTZERS ODER EINER ANDEREN JURISTISCHEN PERSON GENEHMIGEN,

4.6.2 Außer im Zusammenhang mit Softwareprodukten für Bildungseinrichtungen (wie in Ziffer 16.3
definiert), Vorabversionssoftware (wie in Ziffer 16.2 definiert), Evaluierungssoftware, nicht für den
Wiederverkauf vorgesehene Softwarekopien (wie in Ziffer 16.2 definiert) oder Software, die im Rahmen
eines Volumenlizenzierungsprogramms von Adobe bezogen wurde, und vorbehaltlich Ziffer 4.6.3 ist der
Kunde berechtigt, seine Rechte zur Verwendung der Software auf eine andere natürliche oder juristische
Person dauerhaft zu übertragen, sofern: (a) der Kunde (i) diesen Vertrag und (ii) die Seriennummer(n),
die auf von Adobe oder ihrem autorisierten Vertriebshändler zur Verfügung gestellten Medien
enthaltene Software und jede sonstige Software oder Hardware, die mit der Software geliefert, verpackt
oder auf dieser vorinstalliert ist, einschließlich aller Kopien, Updates und früheren Versionen (wie in
Ziffer 5 weiter unten definiert) und (iii) alle Kopien der Schrifttypensoftware ebenfalls an diese natürliche
oder juristische Person überträgt, (b) der Kunde keine Updates, früheren Versionen und Kopien,
einschließlich Sicherungskopien und sonstiger Kopien, die auf einem Computer gespeichert sind,
zurückbehält und (c) der Empfänger die Bestimmungen dieses Vertrags sowie sonstige Bestimmungen
akzeptiert, nach denen der Kunde eine wirksame Softwarelizenz erworben hat. Weitere Informationen
zur Übertragung von im Rahmen eines Volumenlizenzierungsprogramms erworbener Software finden
Sie unter http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_de.
4.6.3 Wenn die Software eine wiederkehrende Aktivierung oder Registrierung erfordert und Adobe dem
Antrag des Kunden auf Befreiung von der Anforderung einer derartigen wiederkehrenden Aktivierung
oder Registrierung stattgibt, endet zusätzlich zu den in den Aktivierungsbedingungen (wie in
--- Page 205 ---
Abschnitt 14.3 definiert) festgelegten Beschränkungen das Recht auf dauerhafte Übertragung gemäß
Ziffer 4.6.2 mit sofortiger Wirkung, sobald einem derartigen Antrag stattgegeben wird.

sind dem Kunden nur im Vertragsgebiet und unter Einhaltung der unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_de festgelegten Aktivierungsbedingungen gestattet. Adobe kann
die hierin erteilte Lizenz kündigen oder die Mitgliedschaft bzw. den Zugriff auf die Online-Dienste von
Adobe aussetzen, wenn Adobe zum Schluss kommt, dass der Kunde die Software oder Online-Dienste
von Adobe außerhalb des Vertragsgebiets verwendet.
5. Updates.
Wenn die Software ein Update einer früheren Version der Software von Adobe ist („frühere Version“),
setzt die Verwendung dieses Updates durch den Kunden voraus, dass er die frühere Version behält.
Wenn der Kunde dieses Update also gemäß Ziffer 4.6 gültig überträgt, muss der Kunde auch die frühere
Version übertragen. Eine Verwendung dieses Updates zusätzlich zur früheren Version ist nur auf
demselben Computer gestattet, auf dem die frühere Version installiert ist und verwendet wird. Etwaige
Verpflichtungen von Adobe zur Unterstützung früherer Versionen während der Lizenzlaufzeit können
mit der Verfügbarkeit dieses Updates enden. Eine anderweitige Verwendung des Updates ist nicht
gestattet. Für zusätzliche Updates kann dem Kunden durch Adobe eine Lizenz mit zusätzlichen oder
abweichenden Bedingungen erteilt werden.
6. Beschränkte Gewährleistung.
Sofern in einem separaten Vertrag zwischen Adobe und einem Softwarelizenznehmer nicht anderweitig
festgelegt, gewährleistet Adobe der natürlichen oder juristischen Person, die erstmals eine Lizenz für die
Verwendung der Software gemäß den Bedingungen dieses Vertrags erwirbt, dass die Software (a) für
einen Zeitraum von neunzig (90) Tagen oder (b) während der Lizenzlaufzeit ab Erhalt der Software
(„Gewährleistungsfrist“), je nachdem, welcher Zeitraum kürzer ist, bei Verwendung auf einem
kompatiblen Computer im Wesentlichen in der Lage ist, die im Benutzerhandbuch beschriebenen
Funktionen auszuführen. Geringfügige Abweichungen von den Beschreibungen im Benutzerhandbuch
begründen keinen Gewährleistungsanspruch. Diese beschränkte Gewährleistung gilt jedoch nicht für
folgende Komponenten, die OHNE MÄNGELGEWÄHR und ohne Gewährleistung bereitgestellt werden:
(i) Korrektursoftware, (ii) Schrifttypensoftware, (iii) Vorabversionssoftware, Testsoftware Startsoftware,
Bewertungen, Produktmuster, Evaluierungssoftware und unverkäufliche Musterkopien der Software,
(iv) Websites, Online-Dienste von Adobe, Online-Dienste von Drittanbietern, (v) Zertifizierungsdienste
(siehe Ziffer 16) sowie (vi) von Adobe kostenlos durch Herunterladen von einer Adobe-Website zur
Verfügung gestellte Software. Alle Gewährleistungsansprüche müssen innerhalb dieser
Gewährleistungsfrist unter Vorlage des Kaufbelegs bei der Kundendienstabteilung von Adobe geltend
gemacht werden. Weitere Informationen zu Gewährleistungsansprüchen finden Sie unter
--- Page 206 ---
http://www.adobe.com/go/support_de. Die Gesamthaftung von Adobe und ihren Tochter- und
Schwesterorganisationen im Zusammenhang mit einem derartigen Gewährleistungsanspruch und die
ausschließlichen Ansprüche des Kunden im Rahmen einer Gewährleistung beschränken sich nach Wahl
von Adobe auf Unterstützung der Software auf der Grundlage des Gewährleistungsanspruchs, Ersatz der
Software oder, wenn eine Unterstützung oder ein Ersatz nach Ermessen von Adobe nicht durchführbar
sind, die Erstattung der vom Kunden gegebenenfalls an Adobe für die Software gezahlten Lizenzgebühr.

Raketensonden oder unbemannten Luftfahrzeugsystemen verwenden wird, oder (c) an einen
Endbenutzer, dem von einer Bundesbehörde der USA die Teilnahme an US-Exportgeschäften untersagt
wurde. Der Kunde ist außerdem verpflichtet, in seiner Rechtsordnung geltende Gesetze zu befolgen, die
sich auf sein Recht zur Einfuhr, Ausfuhr oder Verwendung der Software auswirken können. Wenn Adobe
von einem Verstoß Kenntnis hat, darf Adobe unter Umständen keine Wartungs- und
Unterstützungsdienste für die Software erbringen.
10. Geltendes Recht.
Wenn der Kunde ein Konsument sind, der die Software nur für persönliche nicht geschäftliche Zwecke
verwendet, unterliegt dieser Vertrag dem geltenden Recht des Landes, in dem der Kunde die Lizenz zur
Verwendung der Software erworben haben. Wenn der Kunde kein derartiger Konsument ist, unterliegt
dieser Vertrag dem geltenden materiellen Recht (a) des US-Bundesstaats Kalifornien, wenn der Kunde
eine Softwarelizenz in den Vereinigten Staaten, Kanada oder Mexiko erwirbt; (b) Japans, wenn der
Kunde eine Softwarelizenz in Japan erwirbt; oder (c) Singapurs, wenn der Kunde eine Softwarelizenz
erwirbt und sich in einem Mitgliedsland der Vereinigung südostasiatischer Staaten, in Festlandchina, in
der Sonderverwaltungszone Hongkong, in der Sonderverwaltungszone Macao, in Taiwan oder in der
Republik Korea befindet; oder (d) von England und Wales, wenn der Kunde eine Softwarelizenz in

Bezirk Santa Clara, Kalifornien (bei Anwendbarkeit kalifornischen Rechts); das Bezirksgericht Tokio,
Japan (bei Anwendbarkeit japanischen Rechts); und die zuständigen Gerichte in London, England (bei
Anwendbarkeit englischen oder walisischen Rechts). Falls das Recht Singapurs gilt, werden alle
Streitigkeiten aus dieser Vereinbarung, einschließlich aller Fragen bezüglich ihrer Existenz, Gültigkeit
oder Kündigung, gemäß der jeweils geltenden Schiedsgerichtsordnung des internationalen
Schiedsgerichts in Singapur (diese Schiedsgerichtsordnung gilt als durch Bezugnahme in diesen
Paragraphen aufgenommen) durch ein Schiedsverfahren in Singapur endgültig beigelegt. Es wird ein
von beiden Parteien gemeinsam gewählter Schiedsrichter eingesetzt. Wird der Schiedsrichter nicht
--- Page 208 ---
innerhalb von dreißig (30) Tagen ab der schriftlichen Anfrage durch eine Vertragspartei zur Einleitung
eines Schiedsverfahrens ausgewählt, ist die Auswahl des Schiedsrichters vom Vorsitzenden des
internationalen Schiedsgerichts in Singapur zu treffen. Die Sprache des Schiedsverfahrens ist Englisch.
Unbeschadet etwaiger Bestimmungen dieses Vertrags können Adobe oder der Kunde einen beliebigen
anderen Richter, Verwaltungsbeamten oder eine andere Behörde mit jeglichen anderen Maßnahmen
betrauen, einschließlich einstweiliger Verfügungen, effektiver Vertragserfüllung oder anderer
billigkeitsrechtlicher Ansprüche, bevor rechtliche bzw. Schiedsverfahren eingeleitet werden oder
während diese stattfinden, um die Rechte und Interessen der jeweiligen Partei zu schützen oder
bestimmte Bedingungen durchzusetzen, die für vorläufige Rechtsbehelfe in Frage kommen. Dieser
Vertrag unterliegt weder (x) den Kollisionsnormen jedweder Rechtsordnung noch (y) dem
Übereinkommen der Vereinten Nationen über Verträge über den internationalen Warenkauf oder dem
(z) US-amerikanischen Software-Lizenzgesetz UCIT, deren Anwendung hiermit ausdrücklich
ausgeschlossen wird.
11. Allgemeine Bestimmungen.
Sollte sich herausstellen, dass ein Teil des vorliegenden Vertrags ungültig oder nicht durchsetzbar ist,
wird die Gültigkeit und Durchsetzbarkeit des übrigen Vertrags davon nicht berührt. Eine Änderung des
vorliegenden Vertrags ist nur in schriftlicher Form zulässig, die von einem bevollmächtigten Vertreter
von Adobe unterzeichnet werden muss. In Bezug auf die Interpretation und Auslegung dieses Vertrages
ist nur die englische Version dieses Vertrages gültig. Dies ist der vollständige Vertrag zwischen Adobe
und dem Kunden bezüglich der Software. Er ersetzt alle bisherigen Erklärungen, Besprechungen,
Zusicherungen, Mitteilungen oder Vorankündigungen hinsichtlich der Software.
12. Hinweis für US-Regierungsbehörden als Endbenutzer.
12.1 Lizenzierung von Adobe-Technologie an US-Regierungsbehörden. Der Kunde erklärt, dass die
Lizenz für die Adobe-Software, soweit diese zum Erwerb durch eine US-Behörde oder in deren Auftrag
vergeben wird, gemäß den Bestimmungen von 48 C.F.R. Abschnitt 12.212 (für zivile Behörden) und 48
C.F.R. Abschnitt 227.7202-1 und 227.7202-4 (für das Verteidigungsministerium) erteilt wird. Ist der
Endbenutzer eine US-Regierungsbehörde, so verpflichtet sich Adobe, alle anwendbaren Gesetze zur
Chancengleichheit anzuwenden, einschließlich der Bestimmungen von Rechtsverordnung (Executive
Order) 11246, einschließlich Ergänzungen, Abschnitt 402 des Gesetzes zur Wiedereingliederungshilfe
für Vietnam-Veteranen (Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act) von 1974 (38 USC 4212),
und Abschnitt 503 des Rehabilitationsgesetzes (Rehabilitation Act) von 1973, einschließlich
Ergänzungen, sowie der Vorschriften in 41 CFR, 60-1 bis 60-60, 60-250 und 60-741. Die Gesetze und
Vorschriften über aktive Förderungsmaßnahmen zugunsten von Minderheiten im vorgenannten Satz
sind als Bezug in diesen Vertrag aufzunehmen.
12.2 Handelswaren. Für US-Regierungsbehörden als Endbenutzer ist die Software eine Handelsware im
Sinne von 48 C.F.R. Abschnitt 2.101, bestehend aus „kommerzieller Computersoftware“ und
„Dokumentation für kommerzielle Computersoftware“ im Sinne von 48 C.F.R. Abschnitt 12.212 bzw. 48
C.F.R. Abschnitt 227.7202. Gemäß 48 C.F.R. Abschnitt 12.212 bzw. 48 C.F.R. Abschnitt 227.7202-1
bis 227.7202-4 wird die Lizenz für die kommerzielle Computersoftware und die Dokumentation für
kommerzielle Computersoftware US-Behörden als Endbenutzer (a) nur als Handelsware und (b) nur mit
denjenigen Rechten gewährt, die auch für alle anderen Endbenutzer gemäß den Bestimmungen dieses
Vertrags gelten. Unveröffentlichte Rechte nach den Urheberrechtsgesetzen der Vereinigten Staaten
bleiben vorbehalten.
13. Einhaltung von Lizenzen.
Wenn es sich beim Kunden um ein Unternehmen, eine Gesellschaft oder eine Organisationen handelt,
erklärt sich der Kunde damit einverstanden, dass neben der von der Software durchgeführten
Überprüfung der Lizenzeinhaltung Adobe oder ihr bevollmächtigter Vertreter nach einer
--- Page 209 ---
entsprechenden Benachrichtigung sieben (7) Geschäftstage im Voraus berechtigt ist, die
Aufzeichnungen, Systeme und Einrichtungen des Kunden höchstens einmal alle zwölf (12) Monate zu
überprüfen, um zu bestätigen, dass die Verwendung jedweder Software oder Dienste von Adobe gemäß
den Bestimmungen gültiger Adobe-Lizenzen erfolgt. So ist Adobe beispielsweise berechtigt, jene
Aufzeichnungen des Kunden zu überprüfen, mit deren Hilfe festgestellt werden kann, ob Installationen
der Software serienmäßig vorgenommen wurden, und der Kunde ist verpflichtet, Adobe derartige
Aufzeichnungen nach einer entsprechenden Aufforderung durch Adobe unverzüglich zu übermitteln.
Darüber hinaus muss der Kunde Adobe innerhalb von dreißig (30) Tagen nach Anforderung durch
Adobe alle Unterlagen und Informationen bereitstellen, die von Adobe angefordert werden, um zu
gewährleisten, dass seine Nutzung jeglicher Adobe-Software mit seinen gültigen Lizenzen von Adobe
konform ist. Weitere Informationen zur Serialisierung finden Sie unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_de.
14. Internetzugang und Datenschutz.
14.1 Automatische Internetverbindung. Die Software kann den Computer des Kunden ohne
Benachrichtigung veranlassen, automatisch eine Verbindung zum Internet herzustellen und mit einer
Website oder Domäne von Adobe zu kommunizieren, um u. a. die Lizenz zu überprüfen und dem
Kunden zusätzliche Informationen, Leistungsmerkmale und Funktionen zur Verfügung stellen kann.
Sofern in Ziffer 14.2 bis 14.7 nichts anderes festgelegt ist, gelten die folgenden Bestimmungen für jede
Verbindung, die die Software automatisch zum Internet herstellt:
14.1.1 Wenn die Software eine Verbindung zum Internet herstellt und mit einer Website von Adobe
kommuniziert, gelten die Datenschutzrichtlinien von Adobe, wobei unerheblich ist, ob die Verbindung
automatisch oder auf ausdrücklichen Wunsch des Benutzers hergestellt wird. Laut
Datenschutzrichtlinien von Adobe ist eine Verfolgung von Website-Besuchen erlaubt. In den Richtlinien
wird eingehend auf eine derartige Verfolgung sowie die Verwendung von Cookies, Zählpixeln und
ähnlichen Einrichtungen eingegangen.
14.1.2 Wenn die Software über das Internet eine Verbindung zu Adobe herstellt, werden von der
Software gemäß der Online-Datenschutzrichtlinie von Adobe, die unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_de eingesehen werden kann, („Datenschutzrichtlinie“) bestimmte
Kundendaten erfasst und an Adobe weitergeleitet.
14.1.3 Wenn der Kunde auf einen Online-Dienst von Adobe (wie in Ziffer 16.4 weiter unten definiert)
zugreift oder die Software aktiviert oder registriert, können zusätzliche Daten wie die Adobe-ID, der
Benutzername und das Kennwort des Kunden gemäß der Datenschutzrichtlinie und den zusätzlichen
Nutzungsbedingungen, die für den entsprechenden Online-Dienst von Adobe gelten, (gemeinsam mit
den Adobe.com-Nutzungsbedingungen und sonstigen anwendbaren Bedingungen als „zusätzliche
Nutzungsbedingungen“ bezeichnet) an Adobe übermittelt und von Adobe gespeichert werden.
14.1.4 Soweit gesetzlich zulässig oder wenn der Kunde seine Zustimmung erteilt, kann Adobe (a) dem
Kunden Nachrichten über Transaktionen senden, um den Online-Dienst von Adobe oder die
Aktivierung oder Registrierung der Software oder des Online-Diensts von Adobe zu erleichtern, oder
(b) unter Verwendung von Informationen wie beispielsweise Plattformversion, Softwareversion,
Lizenzstatus und Sprache produktinternes Werbematerial übermitteln, um Informationen über die
Software und andere Produkte und Dienste von Adobe bereitzustellen.
14.2 Aktualisierungen. Die Software kann den Computer des Kunden ohne zusätzliche Benachrichtigung
dazu veranlassen, (von Zeit zu Zeit oder in regelmäßigen Abständen) automatisch eine Verbindung zum
Internet herzustellen, (a) um zu überprüfen, ob Updates zum automatischen Herunterladen auf seinen
Computer und zur Installation verfügbar sind, und (b) um Adobe zu melden, ob die Software erfolgreich
installiert wurde.
14.3 Aktivierung. Zur Verwendung der Software muss der Kunde unter Umständen (a) eine Adobe-ID
erlangen, (b) die Software aktivieren oder erneut aktivieren, (c) die Software registrieren oder (d) die
--- Page 210 ---
Mitgliedschaft bestätigen. In diesem Zusammenhang kann der Computer des Kunden dazu veranlasst
werden, bei der Installation, beim Start oder danach regelmäßig ohne Benachrichtigung eine
Verbindung zum Internet herzustellen. Nach Herstellung der Verbindung erfasst die Software Daten und
übermittelt diese an Adobe, wie unter http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_de
(„Aktivierungsbedingungen“) beschrieben. Die Software oder der Kunde kann auch von Adobe
Informationen zur Lizenz, zum Abonnement oder zur Mitgliedschaft des Kunden erhalten. Adobe kann
derartige Informationen verwenden, um eine betrügerische oder unbefugte Verwendung, die nicht in
Übereinstimmung mit einer gültigen Lizenz, einem Abonnement oder einer Mitgliedschaft erfolgt,
festzustellen oder zu verhindern. Wenn die Software nicht aktiviert oder registriert oder das
Abonnement oder die Mitgliedschaft nicht bestätigt wird oder Adobe eine betrügerische oder
unbefugte Verwendung der Software feststellt, kann dies zur Folge haben, dass die Funktionalität der
Software eingeschränkt wird oder die Software nicht mehr funktionsfähig ist oder das Abonnement oder
die Mitgliedschaft gekündigt oder ausgesetzt wird.
14.4 Deaktivierung. Der Kunde kann die Software auf seinem Computer deaktivieren und deinstallieren,
um die Software auf einem anderen Computer gemäß diesem Vertrag zu installieren und aktivieren
(„Deaktivierung“), wie unter http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_de genauer beschrieben. Zur
Deaktivierung ist eine Internetverbindung erforderlich.
14.5 Inanspruchnahme von Online-Diensten. Die Software kann den Computer des Kunden ohne
zusätzliche Benachrichtigung dazu veranlassen, von Zeit zu Zeit oder in regelmäßigen Abständen
automatisch eine Verbindung zum Internet herzustellen, um auf Inhalte und Dienste zuzugreifen, die
Adobe oder ein Dritter wie in Ziffer 16.4 beschrieben zur Verfügung stellt (Online-Dienste). Die Software
kann ohne zusätzliche Benachrichtigung auch herunterladbare Materialien von diesen Online-Diensten
automatisch aktualisieren, damit diese Dienste auch im Offline-Betrieb umgehend zur Verfügung
stehen.
14.6 Digitale Zertifikate. Die Software verwendet digitale Zertifikate (wie in Ziffer 16.5 beschrieben) zur
Identifizierung herunterladbarer Dateien (z. B. Anwendungen und Inhalte) und der Herausgeber dieser
Dateien. Adobe AIR verwendet z. B. digitale Zertifikate zur Identifizierung des Herausgebers von Adobe
AIR-Anwendungen. Die Adobe Acrobat-Produktfamilie verwendet digitale Zertifikate auch zur
Ausstellung und Validierung von Signaturen in PDF-Dokumenten und zur Validierung zertifizierter PDF-
Dokumente. Bei der Validierung eines digitalen Zertifikats kann der Computer des Kunden eine
Verbindung zum Internet herstellen.
14.7 Einstellungsmanager. Die Software kann Flash Player umfassen. Bei Verwendung von Flash Player
können bestimmte Benutzereinstellungen als LSO (Local Shared Object/gemeinsam genutztes lokales
Objekt) auf dem Computer des Kunden gespeichert werden. Sie stehen mit der Flash Player Instanz auf
dem Computer in Zusammenhang und ermöglichen dem Kunden die Anpassung von
Laufzeitfunktionen. Der Einstellungsmanager für Flash Player ermöglicht die Änderung derartiger
Einstellungen. So kann der Kunde die Speicherung gemeinsam genutzter lokaler Objekte durch Dritte
beschränken oder zulassen, dass Inhalte von Dritten auf das Mikrofon und die Kamera seines
Computers zugreifen. Weitere Informationen zur Konfiguration der Einstellungen der Flash Player
Version des Kunden einschließlich Informationen zur Deaktivierung gemeinsam genutzter lokaler
Objekte im Einstellungsmanager für Flash Player finden Sie unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_de. Weitere Informationen zu gemeinsam genutzten
lokalen Objekten finden Sie unter http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_de.
15. Rechner-Rechner-Verbindung.
Die Software kann ohne zusätzliche Benachrichtigung über die Verbindung des Kunden zu einem
lokalen Netz automatisch eine Verbindung zu anderer Software von Adobe herstellen. Dabei kann die
Software im lokalen Netz bekanntgeben, dass sie zur Kommunikation mit anderer Software von Adobe
verfügbar ist. Bei einer derartigen Verbindung kann die IP-Adresse der Verbindung des Kunden an das
lokale Netz übertragen werden.
--- Page 211 ---
16. Sonderbestimmungen und Ausnahmen.
Diese Ziffer enthält Sonderbestimmungen in Bezug auf bestimmte Produkte und Komponenten der
Software sowie beschränkte Ausnahmen zu den obigen Vertragsbedingungen. Soweit Regelungen in
dieser Ziffer in Widerspruch mit anderen Bedingungen dieses Vertrages stehen, haben die Regelungen
dieser Ziffer Vorrang.
16.1 Keine Beeinträchtigung, Bestimmungen des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, vorgeschriebener
Hinweis für Australien.
16.1.1 Dieser Vertrag darf die gesetzlichen Rechte einer Partei nicht beeinträchtigen, einschließlich
Parteien, die als Verbraucher handeln. Für Verbraucher in Neuseeland, die die Software für persönliche
Zwecke (nicht für geschäftliche Zwecke) erhalten, unterliegt dieser Vertrag beispielsweise den
Bestimmungen des „Consumer Guarantees Act“ (Verbraucherschutzgesetz).
16.1.2 Wenn der Kunde die Software im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum (EWR) erworben hat, seinen
gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt im EWR hat und ein Konsument ist (d. h. wenn die Software zu persönlichen,
nicht geschäftlichen Zwecken verwendet wird), gilt Ziffer 6 (Beschränkte Gewährleistung) bezüglich des
Erwerbs und der Verwendung der Software durch den Kunden nicht. Stattdessen gewährleistet Adobe
für einen Zeitraum von 2 Jahren ab dem Erwerb, dass die Software die im jeweiligen Benutzerhandbuch
beschriebenen Funktionalitäten („die vereinbarten Funktionalitäten“) bereitstellt, wenn sie auf einem
kompatiblen Computer betrieben wird. Geringfügige Abweichungen von den vereinbarten Funktionen
begründen keine Gewährleistungsansprüche. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG GILT NICHT FÜR SOFTWARE,
DIE DER KUNDE ALS VORAB- ODER TESTVERSION, STARTSOFTWARE ODER PRODUKTMUSTER
VERWENDET, ODER FÜR SCHRIFTTYPENSOFTWARE ODER FÜR SOFTWARE, DIE AUFGRUND VON
ÄNDERUNGEN, DIE DER KUNDE VORGENOMMEN HAT, NICHT FUNKTIONIERT. Zur Geltendmachung
von Gewährleistungsansprüchen muss der Kunde die Kundendienstabteilung von Adobe während eines
Zeitraums von 2 Jahren benachrichtigen und einen Kaufbeleg für die Software vorlegen. Adobe teilt
dem Kunden dann mit, ob die Software einen Defekt aufweist oder ob der Fehler auf eine
unsachgemäße Installation durch den Kunden zurückzuführen ist (in diesem Fall erhält der Kunde von
Adobe Unterstützung). Wenn die Software einen Defekt aufweist, kann der Kunde bei Adobe eine
Rückerstattung oder eine reparierte oder Ersatzkopie der Software beantragen. Entsprechenden
Anträgen ist ein Kaufbeleg beizulegen. Wenn der Gewährleistungsanspruch des Kunden berechtigt ist,
erhält er von Adobe eine reparierte oder Ersatzkopie der Software, sofern dies Adobe angemessen
erscheint. Anderenfalls erhält der Kunde von Adobe eine Rückerstattung. Wenn Sie Fragen zur
Gewährleistung haben, setzen Sie sich bitte mit dem Kundendienst von Adobe in Verbindung.
Die Bestimmungen gemäß Ziffer 8 (Haftungsbeschränkung) gelten auch weiterhin für alle
Gewährleistungsansprüche, die der Kunde im Zusammenhang mit der Verwendung der Software stellt.
Ungeachtet dessen haftet Adobe für unmittelbare Schäden, die im Falle einer Verletzung dieses Vertrags
durch Adobe angemessenerweise vorhersehbar sind. Es empfiehlt sich, alle zur Vermeidung oder
Minderung von Schäden angemessenen Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, insbesondere das Erstellen von
Sicherungskopien der Software und der Computerdaten des Kunden.
In diesem Vertrag und insbesondere in Ziffer 16.1.2 werden die Rechte (einschließlich der gesetzlichen
Rechte) beschrieben, die dem Kunden im Falle von Schwierigkeiten bei der Verwendung der Software
zustehen. Wenn die dem Kunden gesetzlich zustehenden Rechte über die hierin beschriebenen Rechte
hinausgehen, gelten die dem Kunden gesetzlich zustehenden Rechte.
16.1.3 Keine in diesem Vertrag enthaltene Bestimmung (einschließlich Ziffer 4.4) schränkt ein nicht
verzichtbares Recht auf Dekompilierung der Software ein, das dem Kunden nach geltendem Recht unter
Umständen zusteht. Wenn der Kunde beispielsweise in der Europäischen Union (EU) ansässig sind, kann
er unter bestimmten Bedingungen laut geltendem Recht berechtigt sein, die Software zu dekompilieren,
wenn dies erforderlich ist, um Interoperabilität zwischen der Software und einem anderen
Softwareprogramm herzustellen, und er zuerst bei Adobe die dazu notwendigen Informationen
angefordert und Adobe dem Kunden entsprechende Informationen nicht bereitgestellt hat. Eine
derartige Dekompilierung darf nur vom Kunden oder von jemandem durchgeführt werden, der
--- Page 212 ---
berechtigt ist, eine Kopie der Software im Namen des Kunden zu verwenden. Adobe ist berechtigt, vor
der Bereitstellung derartiger Informationen angemessene Bedingungen festzulegen. Alle von Adobe
gemäß diesem Vertrag bereitgestellten oder vom Kunden erhaltenen Informationen dürfen vom
Kunden nur zu den hierin aufgeführten Zwecken verwendet werden. Der Kunde ist nicht berechtigt,
diese Informationen an Dritte weiterzugegeben bzw. dazu zu nutzen, um eine Software zu entwickeln,
die dieser Software im Wesentlichen ähnlich ist, oder zu einem anderen Zweck zu verwenden, durch
den das Urheberrecht von Adobe oder ihren Lizenzgebern verletzt wird.
16.1.4 Wenn der Kunde die Software in Australien erwirbt, gilt die folgende Bedingung unbeschadet
etwaiger anderslautender Bestimmungen in diesem Vertrag:
HINWEIS FÜR VERBRAUCHER IN AUSTRALIEN:
Für unsere Produkte gelten Gewährleistungen, die gemäß dem australischen Verbraucherschutzgesetz
nicht ausgeschlossen werden können. Sie haben Anspruch auf Ersatz oder Rückerstattung im Falle eines
erheblichen Mangels und auf eine Entschädigung für jeden anderen angemessenerweise
vorhersehbaren Verlust oder Schaden. Sie haben des Weiteren Anspruch auf eine Reparatur oder einen
Ersatz, wenn die Produkte keine akzeptable Qualität aufweisen und der Mangel keinen erheblichen
Mangel darstellt. Für unsere Softwareprodukte gilt auch eine beschränkte Gewährleistung für die Dauer
von 90 Tagen von Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited mit Sitz in 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business
Campus, Dublin 24, Irland, wie in diesem Vertrag festgelegt. Wenn Ihre Produkte die in der
Benutzerdokumentation beschriebenen allgemeinen Leistungsmerkmale und Funktionen während des
Zeitraums von 90 Tagen nach der Auslieferung an Sie nicht bereitstellen, rufen Sie bitte den Adobe-
Kundendienst unter der Nummer 1800 614 863 an, und teilen Sie die Produktnummer, die
Seriennummer und den Kaufbeleg mit. Sie müssen das Softwareprodukt unter Umständen auf eigene
Kosten an die Ihnen mitgeteilte Adresse zurückschicken. Die Rechte gemäß dieser Gewährleistung
gelten zusätzlich zu anderen Rechten und Rechtsmitteln, die Ihnen von Gesetzes wegen zustehen
können.
16.2 Zusätzliche Bedingungen für die Vorabversion. Wenn es sich bei der Software um eine
unverkäufliche Vorabversion bzw. um Beta-Software handelt („Vorabversionssoftware“), gelten die
Bedingungen dieser Ziffer. Die Vorabversionssoftware ist nicht das endgültige Produkt von Adobe und
kann Fehler und Funktionsstörungen sowie andere Probleme aufweisen, die zu einem System- oder
Hardwareabsturz bzw. zu Datenverlust führen können. Möglicherweise wird die Vorabversionssoftware
von Adobe nie kommerziell vertrieben. Wenn der Kunde die Vorabversionssoftware gemäß einem
gesonderten schriftlichen Vertrag erhalten hat, wie z. B. dem Lizenzvertrag für Vorabversionen von
Software von Adobe Systems Incorporated, unterliegt die Verwendung durch den Kunden ebenfalls
einem solchen Vertrag. Der Kunde muss alle Kopien der Vorabversionssoftware auf Aufforderung durch
Adobe hin oder sofern Adobe diese Software öffentlich kommerziell anbietet (je nachdem, was zuvor
eintritt), unverzüglich vernichten oder zurückgeben. DIE NUTZUNG DER VORABVERSIONSSOFTWARE
DURCH DEN KUNDEN ERFOLGT AUF EIGENES RISIKO. SIEHE ZIFFERN 6 UND 8 FÜR
GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNGEN UND HAFTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNGEN, DIE FÜR
VORABVERSIONSSOFTWARE GELTEN.
16.3 Software für Bildungseinrichtungen. Wenn es sich bei der Software um Software für
Bildungseinrichtungen handelt (d. h. Software, die allein für die Verwendung durch Endbenutzer in
Bildungseinrichtungen hergestellt und vertrieben wird), darf der Kunde die Software nur verwenden,
wenn er im Rahmen der für ihn geltenden Rechtsordnung als Endbenutzer in Bildungseinrichtungen gilt.

Umständen die Software aktivieren, eine Adobe-ID erlangen, den zusätzlichen Nutzungsbedingungen
zustimmen oder eine separate Gebühr bezahlen. Online-Dienste von Adobe sind unter Umständen
nicht in sämtlichen Sprachen und für Einwohner aller Länder verfügbar, und Adobe kann die
Verfügbarkeit eines Online-Dienstes von Adobe jederzeit und gleich aus welchem Grund ändern oder
einstellen. Adobe behält sich auch das Recht vor, für den Zugriff auf einen zuvor kostenlos angebotenen
Online-Dienst von Adobe bzw. für dessen Inanspruchnahme ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt eine
Gebühr in Rechnung zu stellen. Ziffer 14 enthält wichtige Informationen bezüglich Internetverbindung
und Kundendatenschutz. Wie in Ziffer 14 dargelegt, unterliegt die Inanspruchnahme eines Online-
Dienstes von Adobe über die Software den Datenschutzrichtlinien von Adobe
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_de), den Adobe.com-Nutzungsbedingungen
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_de) und zusätzlichen Nutzungsbedingungen, die dem Kunden zum
entsprechenden Zeitpunkt mitgeteilt werden.
16.4.2 Von Dritten bereitgestellt. Die Software ermöglicht dem Kunden unter Umständen Zugang zu
Websites, die von Dritten unterhalten und über die Waren, Informationen, Software und Dienste
angeboten werden („Online-Dienste von Drittanbietern“). Zu derartigen Online-Diensten von
Drittanbietern zählt u. a. Kodak EasyShare Gallery. Der Zugang des Kunden zu Online-Diensten von
Drittanbietern und deren Inanspruchnahme unterliegen den Vertragsbedingungen,
Haftungsausschlüssen und Hinweisen, die auf einer solchen Website angebracht sind oder anderweitig
mit solchen Online-Diensten von Drittanbietern zusammenhängen. Adobe kontrolliert und billigt keine
Online-Dienste von Drittanbietern und übernimmt für diese keine Haftung. Sämtliche Geschäfte
zwischen dem Kunden und einem Dritten in Zusammenhang mit einem Online-Dienst von einem
Drittanbieter, einschließlich der Datenschutzrichtlinien des Drittanbieters und der Verwendung
personenbezogener Informationen, Lieferung und Bezahlung von Waren und Dienstleistungen und
sämtlicher anderer Bestimmungen, Bedingungen, Gewährleistungen und Zusicherungen in
Zusammenhang mit solchen Geschäften, betreffen allein den Kunden und den Dritten. Online-Dienste

16.4.3 SOFERN ADOBE, IHRE TOCHTER- UND SCHWESTERORGANISATIONEN ODER DRITTE NICHT
AUSDRÜCKLICH IN EINER SEPARATEN VEREINBARUNG ETWAS ANDERES VEREINBAREN, NUTZT DER
KUNDE DIE ONLINE-DIENSTE VON ADOBE UND DRITTANBIETERN AUF EIGENES RISIKO GEMÄSS DEN
GEWÄHRLEISTUNGS- UND HAFTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNGEN IN ZIFFERN 7 UND 8.
16.5 Digitale Zertifikate.
16.5.1 Verwendung. Digitale Zertifikate werden von Zertifizierungsdiensten Dritter einschließlich der
Anbieter von Dokumentzertifizierungsdiensten von Adobe (CDS), die unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_de aufgelistet sind, und der AATL-Anbieter (Liste der von
Adobe genehmigten Zertifikate), die unter http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_de aufgeführt sind, (kollektiv
als „Zertifizierungsdienste“ bezeichnet) erstellt oder können selbst ausgestellt werden.
16.5.2 Bestimmungen. Der Erwerb und die Verwendung von digitalen Zertifikaten sowie das damit
verbundene Vertrauen unterliegen der Verantwortung des Kunden und der Verantwortung eines
Zertifizierungsdienstes. Bevor der Kunde auf ein zertifiziertes Dokument, eine digitale Signatur oder
Zertifizierungsdienste vertraut, sollte er die geltenden Bedingungen durchlesen, zu denen der jeweilige
Zertifizierungsdienstanbieter die Dienste anbietet, insbesondere z. B. Bezugsverträge, Vereinbarungen
mit vertrauenden Parteien, Zertifizierungsrichtlinien und Geschäftsgepflogenheiten. Weitere
--- Page 214 ---
Informationen zu CDS-Anbietern von Adobe finden Sie unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_de und zu AATL-Anbietern von Adobe unter
http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_de.
16.5.3 Bestätigung. Der Kunde erklärt sich damit einverstanden, dass (a) die Software aufgrund von
Konfiguration oder externen Problemen eine Signatur als gültig anzeigen kann, obwohl ein digitales
Zertifikat vor dem Zeitpunkt der Verifizierung widerrufen oder abgelaufen sein kann, wodurch die
digitale Signatur oder das Zertifikat gültig zu sein scheint, obwohl dies nicht der Fall ist, (b) die Sicherheit
und Integrität eines digitalen Zertifikats aufgrund einer Handlung oder Unterlassung des Unterzeichners
des Dokuments, des entsprechenden Zertifizierungsdienstanbieters oder eines anderen Dritten
gefährdet sein können und (c) es sich um ein selbst ausgestelltes und nicht von einem
Zertifizierungsdienstanbieter ausgefertigtes Zertifikat handeln kann. DIE ENTSCHEIDUNG, OB DER
KUNDE AUF EIN ZERTIFIKAT VERTRAUT, LIEGT AUSSCHLIESSLICH IN SEINER VERANTWORTUNG. DIE
VERWENDUNG DIGITALER ZERTIFIKATE ERFOLGT AUF EIGENES RISIKO, ES SEI DENN, EIN
ZERTIFIZIERUNGSDIENSTANBIETER ERTEILT DEM KUNDEN EINE GESONDERTE SCHRIFTLICHE
GARANTIE.
16.5.4 Drittbegünstigte. Der Kunde stimmt zu, dass der Zertifizierungsdienstanbieter, auf den er vertraut,
ein Drittbegünstigter dieses Vertrags und somit berechtigt ist, die Bestimmungen dieses Vertrags in
seinem eigenen Namen in gleicher Weise wie Adobe durchzusetzen.
16.5.5 Haftungsfreistellung. Der Kunde stimmt zu, Adobe und den betreffenden
Zertifizierungsdienstanbieter (außer im Rahmen seiner ausdrücklich festgelegten Bedingungen) von
allen Haftungs-, Verlust-, Gewährleistungs- oder Schadensersatzansprüchen und –klagen (einschließlich
aller damit verbundenen angemessenen Auslagen und Kosten sowie der angemessenen Kosten der
Rechtsverteidigung), die aus oder in Zusammenhang mit der Verwendung durch den Kunden oder dem
Vertrauen auf einen Dienst des entsprechenden Anbieters entstehen, freizustellen, einschließlich, aber
nicht beschränkt auf: (a) Vertrauen in ein abgelaufenes oder widerrufenes Zertifikat, (b) inkorrekte
Verifizierung eines Zertifikats, (c) Verwendung eines Zertifikats, das nicht im Rahmen der geltenden
Bestimmungen, dieses Vertrages oder des geltenden Rechts zugelassen ist, (d) Nichtausübung einer
angemessenen Einschätzung der Umstände, unter denen auf Dienste oder Zertifikate des Anbieters
vertraut wurde, oder (e) Nichterfüllung von Verpflichtungen, die gemäß den entsprechenden
Bestimmungen im Zusammenhang mit den Diensten erforderlich sind.
16.6 Schrifttypensoftware. Sofern die Software Schrifttypensoftware enthält, gilt Folgendes:
16.6.1 Der Kunde darf die Schrifttypensoftware zusammen mit der Software auf Computern wie unter
Ziffer 2 beschrieben verwenden und die Schrifttypensoftware über mit dem Computer verbundene
Ausgabegeräte ausgeben.
16.6.2 Sofern die zulässige Anzahl an Computern fünf (5) oder weniger beträgt, darf der Kunde die
Schrifttypensoftware auf den Speicher (Festplatte oder RAM) eines mit mindestens einem dieser
Computer verbundenen Ausgabegerätes herunterladen, damit die Schrifttypensoftware auf diesem
Ausgabegerät verbleibt. Des Weiteren darf der Kunde die Schrifttypensoftware für jedes Vielfache von
fünf innerhalb der zulässigen Anzahl von Computern auf ein weiteres Ausgabegerät herunterladen.
16.6.3 Der Kunde darf eine Kopie der Schrifttypen, die er für eine bestimmte Datei genutzt hat, an eine
gewerbliche Druckerei oder ein anderes Serviceunternehmen weitergeben, und dieses
Serviceunternehmen darf die Schrifttypensoftware zur Verarbeitung seiner Dateien verwenden,
vorausgesetzt, es verfügt über eine gültige Lizenz zur Verwendung dieser Schrifttypensoftware.
16.6.4 Der Kunde darf Kopien der Schrifttypensoftware in seine elektronischen Dokumente integrieren,
um diese zu drucken, anzusehen oder zu bearbeiten. Unter dieser Lizenz werden keine weiteren Rechte
zum Integrieren gewährt oder vorausgesetzt.

Schrifttypen dar, die ausschließlich zum Betrieb der Softwarebenutzerschnittstelle und nicht zur
--- Page 215 ---
Integration in Ausgabedateien in der Software enthalten sind. Derartige aufgelistete Schrifttypen sind
nicht gemäß Ziffer 16.6 lizenziert. Der Kunde erklärt, dass er derartige aufgelistete Schrifttypen in bzw.
mit keinen Softwareanwendungen, Programmen oder Dateien mit Ausnahme der Software kopieren,
verschieben, aktivieren oder verwenden darf und dafür sorgen muss, dass kein
Schrifttypenverwaltungswerkzeug derartige aufgelistete Schrifttypen kopiert, verschiebt, aktiviert oder

wurde, dass sie das lokale Abspeichern von Dokumenten mit ausgefüllten PDF-Formularen ermöglicht.
16.8.2 Die Software kann Aktivierungstechnologie enthalten, die es dem Kunden ermöglicht, PDF-
Dokumente mit bestimmten Eigenschaften durch die Nutzung eines digitalen Berechtigungsnachweises
innerhalb der Software („Schlüssel“) auszustatten. Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, auf diesen Schlüssel nicht
zuzugreifen, ihn nicht zu steuern, zu deaktivieren, zu entfernen, zu nutzen oder zu vertreiben, gleich für
welchen Zweck.

Lizenz erworben hat, mit der Maßgabe, dass Testversionen der Adobe Contribute Software die
Contribute Publishing Services Software gemäß den Bestimmungen der Endbenutzerlizenzvereinbarung
für die Contribute Publishing Services Software installieren und eine Verbindung zu ihr herstellen
dürfen.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Sofern die Software Adobe Presenter beinhaltet und der Kunde das Adobe
Acrobat Connect Add-in in Verbindung mit der Nutzung der Software installiert oder verwendet, stimmt
der Kunde zu, dass er ein derartiges Add-in ausschließlich auf einem Desktopcomputer und nicht auf
Produkten, die keine PCs sind, einschließlich unter anderem einer Internetanwendung, eines
Digitalempfängers, eines tragbaren Geräts, eines Telefons oder eines Web-Pad-Geräts installiert oder
verwendet. Des Weiteren dürfen Teile der Software, die in mit Hilfe der Software erstellte

verwenden, und er muss dafür Sorge tragen, dass Lizenznehmer entsprechender Präsentationen, Daten
oder Inhalte Adobe Presenter Run-Time nicht ändern, zurückentwickeln oder disassemblieren.

szerződést), az ilyen szerződés kiegészíti a jelen szerződést, illetve a jelen szerződés teljes egészének
vagy egyes részeinek a helyébe lép. A szerződés a Szoftverre HASZNÁLATI ENGEDÉLYT ad, mely csak a
jelen szerződés feltételeinek betartása esetén érvényes, A VÁSÁRLÓ NEM VÁLIK A SZOFTVER
TULAJDONOSÁVÁ. A Szoftverben foglalt vagy azon keresztül elért egyes Adobe és egyes nem-Adobe
anyagok és szolgáltatások használata egyéb feltételek alá eshet. A nem-Adobe anyagokkal kapcsolatos
tájékoztatások elérhetőek a http://www.adobe.com/go/thirdparty_hu oldalon.
A Szoftver AUTOMATIKUSAN CSATLAKOZTATHATJA a Vásárló Számítógépét az INTERNETHEZ. A
Szoftver igényelhet aktiválást vagy regisztrációt. További információt az aktiválásról, Internethez
kapcsolhatóságról és adatkezelésről a 14. és 16. pontban talál.
1. Értelmező rendelkezések.
1.1 Amennyiben a Vásárló a jelen szerződést az Egyesült Államokban, Kanadában vagy Mexikóban való
tartózkodása során köti meg, az „Adobe” az Adobe Systems Incorporated, Delaware államban
bejegyzett társaságot jelenti, melynek címe: 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, Kalifornia 95110; más
esetekben az „Adobe” az Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business
Campus, Dublin 24, Ír Köztársaság) társaságra vonatkozik.
1.2 Az „Adobe Runtime(s)” az Adobe AIR, az Adobe Flash Player, a Shockwave Player vagy az
Authorware Player szoftvert jelenti.
1.3 A „Kompatibilis Számítógép” olyan számítógépet jelent, amely rendelkezik a Dokumentációban
megadott, ajánlott operációs rendszerrel és hardverkonfigurációval.
1.4 A „Számítógép” olyan virtuális vagy fizikai eszközt jelent, amely digitális vagy hasonló formában
információt fogad, és egy meghatározott eredmény elérése érdekében az utasítások sorrendjének
megfelelően kezel, beleértve, de nem kizárólag, az asztali számítógépeket, laptopokat, tableteket,
mobiltelefonokat, telekommunikációs eszközöket, Internethez csatlakoztatott eszközöket, valamint a
termelő, szórakoztató vagy más szoftver alkalmazások széles skáláját működtetni képes hardver
termékeket.
1.5 A „Vásárló” szó alatt értendő Ön és bármely olyan jogi személy, aki megszerezte a Szoftvert, és
akinek a nevében azt használják; például – amennyiben alkalmazható – az Ön munkaadója.
1.6 A „Belső Hálózat” kizárólag egy meghatározott társaság vagy hasonló üzleti vállalkozás
alkalmazottai és egyes vállalkozói (vagyis ideiglenes alkalmazottak) által hozzáférhető, zártkörű, saját
tulajdonú hálózati erőforrást jelent. A Belső Hálózat nem tartalmazza az Internetet vagy a nyilvánosság
számára elérhető egyéb hálózati közösségeket, mint például a tagságon vagy előfizetésen alapuló
csoportokat, társulásokat és hasonló szervezeteket.
--- Page 231 ---
1.7 Az „Output Fájl” a Vásárló által a Szoftver használatával létrehozott kimeneti állományt jelenti.
1.8 Az „Engedélyezett Mennyiség” egy (1), hacsak az Adobe által adott érvényes engedély (pl.
kötetengedély) más számot nem jelöl meg.
1.9 A „Szoftver” magába foglalja (a) mindazokat az információkat, amelyekről a jelen megállapodás
rendelkezik, beleértve többek között – de nem kizárólag – az alábbiakat: (i) minden szoftverállományt
és egyéb számítógépes információt; (ii) bármely, exportált fájlformátumba beágyazott vagy Adobe
Online Szolgáltatásban használt, szellemi tulajdont képező programkódot; (iii) a minta- és
készletfotókat, képeket, hangokat, grafikai könyvtárat és egyéb művészeti alkotásokat, amelyek az
Adobe szoftver tartozékai, vagy amelyeket az Adobe tett elérhetővé az Adobe weboldalán, az Adobe
szoftverekkel való használathoz, és nem az Adobe-tól külön szolgáltatásként (kivéve, ha azon
szolgáltatás keretében arról másképp rendelkeznek) vagy harmadik féltől kerültek beszerzésre
(„Tartalomállományok”); (iv) a kapcsolódó magyarázó írásos anyagokat és állományokat
(„Dokumentációk”); (v) a karakterkészleteket; valamint (b) ezen információk módosított változatait és
másolatait, illetve bővítéseit, frissítéseit és kiegészítéseit, amelyeket az Adobe bármikor, külön feltételek
nélkül bocsát a Vásárló rendelkezésére (együttesen: „Frissítések”).
2. Szoftverhasználati jog; Tagság.
2.1 Szoftverhasználati jog. A 2.1 bekezdés azokra a Vásárlókra vonatkozik, akik megvásárolták a Szoftver
licencét, de nem vásároltak tagság alapú licencet vagy szolgáltatást, például Creative Cloud tagságot
(amint az a 2.2 bekezdésben olvasható).
2.1.1 Licencjogok. Amennyiben a Vásárló folyamatosan teljesíti a jelen szerződés feltételeit, és megfizeti
a vonatkozó licencdíjakat, az Adobe nem kizárólagos felhasználói engedélyt ad a Vásárlónak a Szoftver
telepítésére és használatára (a) azon a területen vagy régióban, ahol a Vásárló megvásárolta a Szoftvert
Adobe-tól vagy az Adobe engedéllyel rendelkező viszonteladójától, vagy ha a Dokumentációban
másképpen van jelölve, annak megfelelően („Terület”), (b) a licenc érvényességének ideje alatt
(„Licencidő”), (c) a Licenctípus által engedélyezett lehetőségeken belül és a Vásárló tulajdonában lévő, a
Dokumentációban meghatározott Engedélyezett Számú Kompatibilis Számítógépen, (d) a jelen
Szerződés és a vonatkozó Dokumentáció feltételeinek megfelelő módon. Hacsak a jelen Szerződésben,
a vonatkozó Dokumentációban vagy a vásárlás idejében másképp meghatározásra nem kerül, a
Licencidő örökre szól. A Licencidő lejáratát vagy felmondását követően a Szoftver működése előzetes
értesítés nélkül leállhat. A Licencidő lejáratát vagy felmondását követően a Vásárló nem használhatja a
Szoftvert, hacsak meg nem újítja a licencet. Az ezúton biztosított licencet a 16 pontban található különös
rendelkezések egészítik ki, mint a bizonyos termékek és komponensek, így többek között a betűkészlet-
szoftver, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital
Publishing Suite, és Adobe Runtimes használatára vonatkozó különös rendelkezések.
2.1.2 Licenctípusok.
2.1.2.1 Sorozatszám nélküli Szoftver. A sorozatszámmal el nem látott Szoftver vagy annak részei
kizárólag demonstrációs, értékelési és oktatási célból telepíthetők és használhatók bármely számú
Kompatibilis Számítógépen a szervezeti telepítési terv részeként, a Licencidő alatt, és csak azzal a
feltétellel, hogy a segítségükkel létrehozott Output Fájlokat vagy egyéb anyagokat kizárólag belső, nem
kereskedelmi és nem termelési célokra használják fel. A SOROZATSZÁM NÉLKÜLI SZOFTVER
„MEGTEKINTETT ÁLLAPOTBAN” KERÜLT ÁTADÁSRA. AZ SOROZATSZÁM NÉLKÜLI SZOFTVERREL
KÉSZÍTETT OUTPUT FÁJLOKHOZ VALÓ HOZZÁFÉRÉS ÉS AZOK HASZNÁLATA KIZÁRÓLAG A
VÁSÁRLÓ SAJÁT FELELŐSSÉGÉRE TÖRTÉNIK.
2.1.2.2 Értékelőszoftver. Az „értékelési célú” vagy egyéb hasonló célra tervezett (például külön
megállapodás értelmében biztosított Szoftver vagy „EVAL” sorozatszámú) Szoftver vagy Szoftverrészek
(„Értékelőszoftver”) kizárólag demonstrációs, értékelési és oktatási célból telepíthetők és használhatók
Engedélyezett Számú Kompatibilis Számítógépen, és csak azzal a feltétellel, hogy a segítségükkel
létrehozott Output Fájlokat vagy egyéb anyagokat kizárólag belső, nem kereskedelmi és nem termelési
--- Page 232 ---
célokra használják fel. AZ ÉRTÉKELŐSZOFTVER „MEGTEKINTETT ÁLLAPOTBAN” KERÜLT ÁTADÁSRA.
AZ ÉRTÉKELŐSZOFTVERREL KÉSZÍTETT OUTPUT FÁJLOKHOZ VALÓ HOZZÁFÉRÉS ÉS AZOK
HASZNÁLATA KIZÁRÓLAG A VÁSÁRLÓ SAJÁT FELELŐSSÉGÉRE TÖRTÉNIK.
2.1.2.3 Előfizetői kiadás. Az előfizetői alapon elérhető Szoftverek esetében („Előfizetői Kiadás”) a Vásárló
az Előfizetői Kiadást csak Engedélyezett Számú Kompatibilis Számítógépre telepítheti, és csak ezeken
használhatja a Licencidő alatt. Figyelembe véve az Előfizetői Kiadáshoz Engedélyezett Számú
Számítógépeket, az Adobe engedélyezheti a Vásárlónak, hogy telepítse és használja az Előfizetői Kiadás
legfrissebb verziójánál korábbi verziót és az Előfizetői Kiadás legújabb verzióját ugyanazon a
számítógépen a Licencidő alatt. A Vásárló elfogadja, hogy az Adobe bármikor megváltoztathatja a
Szoftver típusát (például adott komponenseket, verziókat, platformokat, nyelveket, stb.), beleértve az
Előfizetői Kiadást, és legcsekélyebb mértékben sem tartozik a Vásárlónak semmilyen felelősséggel
ezekért a változtatásokért. Az Előfizetői Kiadás folyamatos használatához a következők szükségesek:
(a) rendszeres internetkapcsolat, melyen keresztül aktiválható, megújítható és érvényesíthető a licenc,
(b) az Adobe vagy az Adobe egy engedéllyel rendelkező viszonteladója nyugtával igazolja az
előfizetések rendszeres befizetését, és (c) a Vásárló elfogadja az előfizetői feltételeket és egyéb további
feltételeket, melyek elérhetőek a http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_hu oldalon vagy a vásárlás
időpontjában. Ha az Adobe nem kapja meg a rendszeres előfizetési összeget, vagy nem tudja
időszakonként érvényesíteni a licencet, akkor a Szoftver inaktívvá válthat további értesítés nélkül, amíg
az Adobe meg nem kapja az előfizetést vagy nem érvényesíti a licencet.
2.1.3 Hordozható vagy otthoni számítógép használata. Figyelembe véve a 2.1.4 pontban található
megszorításokat, annak a Számítógépnek az elsődleges felhasználója („Elsődleges Felhasználó”),
amelyre a Szoftvert a 2.1 pont értelmében telepítették, a Szoftver második példányát – saját
kizárólagos használatra – hordozható Számítógépre vagy az otthonában található Számítógépre
telepítheti, feltéve, hogy a hordozható vagy otthoni Számítógépre telepített Szoftvert nem
használják egyidejűleg az elsődleges Számítógépen is.
2.1.4 A Szoftver második példányának kötetengedélyesek általi használatára vonatkozó megszorítások.
Amennyiben egy felhasználó – az oktatási kötetengedélyest kivéve – a Szoftvert egy Adobe
kötetengedély-program vagy szerződés (például Adobe Volume Licensing) keretében szerezte meg, a
Szoftvernek a jelen szerződés 2.1.3 pont alapján készített második példánya csak a kötetengedélyes
üzleti vállalkozásával, illetve a kötetengedélyes érdekében használható.
2.1.5 Dual-boot Platform. A Szoftver használata egyetlen operációsrendszer-platformon engedélyezett.
A Vásárlónak a Szoftver minden egyes operációsrendszer-platformon való használatához külön
engedélyt kell vásárolnia. Ha a Vásárló a Szoftvert például Mac OS és Windows operációs rendszerre is
telepíteni kívánja egy olyan eszközön, melyen mindkét operációs rendszer futtatható (azaz dual-boot
gépen), akkor a Szoftverre előzőleg két külön licencet kell szereznie. Ez abban az esetben is igaz, ha
egyazon eszközön a Szoftver két – különböző operációsrendszer-platformokra tervezett – verzióját
adják át a Vásárlónak.
2.1.6 Szerveren keresztüli terjesztés. Amint azt a Dokumentáció engedélyezi, a Vásárló a Szoftver egy
képmását felmásolhatja a Belső Hálózatán belüli számítógépes állományszerverre („Szerver”) abból a
célból, hogy a Szoftvert az ugyanazon Belső Hálózathoz tartozó Számítógépekre kizárólag a 2 pontban
engedélyezett felhasználás céljára letöltse és telepítse.
2.1.7 Szerverhasználat.
2.1.7.1 Mint az egy külön beszerzési dokumentumban vagy a Dokumentációban engedélyezésre került,
alávetve a jelen Szerződésben megfogalmazott licencmegszorításoknak, a Vásárló csak azzal a céllal
telepítheti a Szoftvert egy Szerverre, hogy ugyanazon Belső Hálózathoz tartozó Számítógépnél lévő
egyén („Hálózati Felhasználó”) hozzáférhessen a Szoftverhez és használhassa azt. Annak a Hálózati
Felhasználónak, aki hozzáféréssel rendelkezik a Szerveren ehhez a Szoftverhez, a megnevezése:
„Szerveren keresztüli Szoftverfelhasználó”. A Szerveren keresztüli Szerverfelhasználók száma (nem a
Szervert egyszerre használó felhasználók száma) nem haladhatja meg az Engedélyezett Számot.
Példának okáért, ha a Vásárló a Szoftverhez 10 licencet vásárolt (vagyis az Engedélyezett Szám 10), és a
--- Page 233 ---
Vásárló úgy dönt, hogy telepíti a Szoftvert egy Szerverre, akkor a Vásárló csak 10 Szerveren keresztüli
Szerverfelhasználónak teheti lehetővé a Szoftverhez való hozzáférést (még akkor is, ha a Vásárló 10-nél
több Hálózati Felhasználóval rendelkezik, vagy a Szoftvert egyszerre 10-nél kevesebb felhasználó
használja).
2.1.7.2 A tisztázás kedvéért és minden korlátozás nélkül megállapítandó, hogy az előzőekben írottak
nem engedélyezik, hogy a Vásárló (közvetlenül, ill. parancsok, adatok vagy utasítások útján) telepítse
vagy elérje a Szoftvert: (a) olyan Számítógépről vagy Számítógépre, amely nem tartozik a Belső
Hálózatba, (b) Web alapú munkacsoportok vagy szolgáltatások nyilvános helyen lehetővé tétele
céljából; (c) olyan magánszemély vagy jogi személy által, aki érvényes Adobe engedély hiányában nem
jogosult a Szoftver használatára, letöltésére, másolására vagy egyéb hasznosítására, vagy (d) valamely
rendszer, munkafolyamat vagy szolgáltatás összetevőjeként, amelyhez az Engedélyezett Mennyiségnél
nagyobb számú felhasználó férhet hozzá; vagy (e) nem egyedi felhasználó által kezdeményezett
műveletekre (mint például automata kiszolgáló, amely az adatfeldolgozást biztosítja).
2.2 Tagság. A 2.2 pont azokra a Vásárlókra vonatkozik, akik tagságalapú licencet vagy szolgáltatást
vásároltak, például Creative Cloud tagságot (együttesen: „Tagságot”).
2.2.1 Tagsággal kapcsolatos Adobe Online Szolgáltatások. Amennyiben a Vásárló folyamatosan teljesíti
a jelen Szerződés feltételeit, és megfizeti a vonatkozó tagdíjakat, ha van ilyen, az Adobe nem
kizárólagos, Területre érvényes és korlátozott felhasználói engedélyt ad a Vásárlónak a Szoftverhez és a
vonatkozó Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokhoz való hozzáférésre és azok használatára (további részletekért
ld. a 16.4.1 pontot) a Tagság részeként, figyelembe véve a jelen Szerződésben és a Kiegészítő
Felhasználási Feltételekben (amint az alább, a 14.1.3 pontban meghatározásra került) foglalt
feltételeket.
2.2.2 Tagsággal kapcsolatos Szoftverlicenc. Amennyiben a Vásárló folyamatosan teljesíti a jelen
Szerződés feltételeit, és megfizeti a vonatkozó tagdíjakat, amennyiben van ilyen, az Adobe nem
kizárólagos és korlátozott licencet ad Vásárlónak a Szoftver telepítésére és használatára: (a) a Területen,
(b) az idő alatt, míg a Tagság aktuális és aktív („Tagságidő”) és (c) olyan módon, hogy az összeférhető
legyen a jelen Szerződés és a vonatkozó Dokumentáció feltételeivel. A Tagságidő lejáratát vagy
felmondását követően (x) a Szoftver egy része vagy egésze működése előzetes értesítés nélkül leállhat,
és (y) Vásárló nem használhatja a Szoftvert, hacsak meg nem újítja a tagságát. Az adott Szoftverhez
kapcsolódó összes feltétel, a jelen Szerződésben megállapított formában hatályban marad, és továbbra
is érvényes lesz a Vásárlóra és az ő Szoftverhasználatára.
2.2.3 Korlátozások. A Vásárló elfogadja a következő kiegészítő feltételeket és megkötéseket a Tagságra
vonatkozólag: (a) az Adobe bármikor megváltoztathatja a Tagságban foglalt Szoftver típusát (mint
például bizonyos termékeket, összetevőket, verziókat, platformokat, nyelveket, stb.), és legcsekélyebb
mértékben sem tartozik a Vásárlónak semmilyen felelősséggel ezekért a változtatásokért; (b) a Vásárlót
kötelezhetik, hogy a Tagságidő alatt bármikor felcsatlakozhasson az Internethez, és bejelentkezhessen;
(c) a Szoftver bármikor, előzetes értesítés nélkül automatikusan csatlakozhat az Internethez, hogy
érvényesítse a Vásárló Tagságát; és (d) a Vásárló nem teheti lehetővé vagy nem engedélyezheti
másoknak, hogy Vásárlóként használják ezt a Szoftvert.
2.3 Tartalomállományok. A Tartalomállományokhoz rendelt „Olvass el” állományok vagy más
engedély(ek) ellenkező rendelkezése hiányában a Vásárlók a Tartalomállományokat használhatják,
megjeleníthetik, módosíthatják, másolhatják és terjeszthetik. Ugyanakkor a Tartalomállományok nem
terjeszthetők önmagukban (vagyis olyan esetben, amikor a Tartalomállományok a forgalmazott termék
elsődleges értékét képezik), és a Tartalomállományok vagy származtatott alkotásaik tekintetében
védjegyjogok nem követelhetők. Semmilyen itt közölt tény nem befolyásolhatja a Szoftver
tulajdonjogát, mint az a 3 pontban megállapítást nyert.
2.4 Mintaalkalmazási kód. A Vásárló jogosult a forráskód vagy a Szoftver azon részeinek módosítására,
amelyek kifejezetten mint mintakód (sample code), mintaalkalmazási kód (sample application code),
kóddarabok, ActionScript class files, vagy minta tartozékaként (a továbbiakban mindegyik
„Mintaalkalmazási Kód”) kerültek megjelölésre a kapcsolódó Dokumentációban, de kizárólag az Adobe
--- Page 234 ---
szoftverprogram által kifejlesztett weboldal, illetve weboldalhoz tartozó alkalmazások tervezésére,
készítésére és tesztelésére. A Vásárló csak abban az esetben jogosult a (módosított vagy módosítástól
mentes) Mintaalkalmazási Kód másolására és továbbadására, ha az alábbi feltételek mindegyike
teljesül: (a) a Vásárló csak a befordított objektumú Minta Alkalmazási Kódot adja tovább a Vásárló
alkalmazásával együtt, (b) a Minta Alkalmazási Kód nem lesz része semmilyen weboldal fejlesztésére
készített terméknek, valamint (c) a Vásárló az Adobe nevet, logót, vagy bármely más Adobe védjegyet
nem használja fel a terméke értékesítéséhez. A Vásárló köteles az Adobe-ot minden olyan veszteség,
kár, követelés vagy peres eljárás – ideértve az ügyvédi munkadíjakat is – alól mentesíteni, amely a
Vásárló alkalmazásának használatából vagy továbbadásából származik, vagy annak eredménye.
2.5 Programozási nyelvek. A Szoftver magában foglalhatja az ExtendScript SDK és a Pixel Bender SDK
egyes részeit. A 2 pontban foglalt korlátozások szem előtt tartásával az Adobe nem kizárólagos, nem
átruházható, jogdíjmentes engedélyt biztosít a Vásárlónak az ExtendScript SDK-ban és Pixel Bender
SDK-ban lévő elemek – kizárólag az Adobe termékekkel való működésre tervezett alkalmazási
programok belső kifejlesztésének céljára történő – felhasználására. A 2.5 pontban kifejezetten előírtak
kivételével az ExtendScript SDK vagy Pixel Bender SDK semmilyen része nem módosítható vagy
terjeszthető. A Vásárló köteles az Adobe-ot minden olyan veszteség, kár, követelés vagy peres eljárás –
ideértve az ügyvédi munkadíjakat is – alól mentesíteni, amely az ilyen terjesztésből származik, vagy
annak eredménye.
2.6 Másolatok a Dokumentációról. A Vásárló készíthet másolatokat a Dokumentációról saját belső
használata céljára a Szoftver használatával összefüggésben a jelen Szerződésnek megfelelően, de csak
az ésszerűen szükséges mennyiségben.
3. Szellemi tulajdonjog.
A Szoftver és a Vásárló által másolt engedélyezett példányok az Adobe Systems Incorporated és
beszállítói szellemi tulajdonai, és azok tulajdonában állnak. A Szoftver felépítése, elrendezése és
forráskódja az Adobe Systems Incorporated és beszállítói számára nagy értéket képviselő üzleti titoknak
és bizalmas információnak minősül. A Szoftvert különböző jogszabályok védik, ideértve korlátozás
nélkül az Egyesült Államok és más országok szerzői jogi törvényeit, illetve nemzetközi egyezmények
rendelkezéseit. A jelen Szerződés nem engedélyez a Vásárlónak semmilyen szellemi tulajdonjogot,
kivéve az itt kifejezetten meghatározottakat. Az Adobe és beszállítói fenntartják a kifejezetten nem
biztosított jogokat.
4. Korlátozások és követelmények.
4.1 Szerzői jogok. A Szoftver Vásárló által készített, megengedett másolatainak (beleértve korlátozás
nélkül a Dokumentációt) ugyanolyan szerzői jogi és más tulajdonjogi figyelmeztetést kell tartalmazniuk,
mint amilyen a Szoftveren vagy a Szoftverben található.
4.2 A használattal kapcsolatos kötelezettségek. A Vásárló beleegyezik, hogy csak a jelen Szerződésben
engedélyezett módon, valamint csak rendeltetésszerűen és a Dokumentációban foglaltaknak
megfelelően használja a Szoftvert.
4.3 Módosítások kizárása. A 2 vagy a 16 pontban kifejezetten megengedetteket kivéve a Szoftver nem
módosítható, nem változtatható meg a más környezetben való alkalmazás érdekében, nem dolgozható
át, illetve nem konvertálható más formátumba.
4.4 A visszafejtés kizárása. Hacsak kifejezetten nem engedélyezi a 16.1 pont, a Vásárló kötelezettséget
vállal arra, hogy nem fordítja vissza, fejti vissza, bontja vissza, illetve próbálja más módon feltárni a
szoftver forráskódját.
4.5 Együtt kínált termékek különválasztásának kizárása. A Szoftver különféle alkalmazásokat és
alkatrészeket tartalmazhat, lehetővé teheti a különböző Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokhoz való
hozzáférést, összetett platformokat és több nyelvet is támogathat, illetve több kommunikációs eszközön
--- Page 235 ---
és több példányban is biztosítható a Vásárló számára. Mindazonáltal a Szoftver egységes termékként
lett tervezve és átadva a Vásárlónak, hogy a Vásárló egységes termékként használja a Számítógépeken,
amint az itt engedélyezve lett. Hacsak a Dokumentáció másképp nem engedi, a Vásárló nem köteles a
Szoftver minden részét telepíteni, viszont a Vásárló nem választhatja szét a Szoftver összetevő részeit
más Számítógépeken való használathoz.
4.6 Átruházás kizárása.
4.6.1 A SZOFTVERHEZ FŰZŐDŐ JOGOK NEM VEHETŐK ÉS NEM ADHATÓK BÉRBE, NEM ADHATÓK EL,
NEM ADHATÓK TOVÁBB FELHASZNÁLÁSRA, NEM ENGEDMÉNYEZHETŐK ÉS NEM RUHÁZHATÓK ÁT
(KORLÁTOZÁS NÉLKÜL IDEÉRTVE A WEBES LETÖLTÉSEN KERESZTÜL SZERZETT SZOFTVEREKET),
ILLETVE TILOS A SZOFTVER BÁRMELY RÉSZÉNEK ÁTMÁSOLÁSA EGY MÁSIK MAGÁNSZEMÉLY VAGY
JOGI SZEMÉLY SZÁMÍTÓGÉPÉRE, KIVÉVE A JELEN SZERZŐDÉSBEN KIFEJEZETTEN MEGENGEDETT
ESETEKET.
4.6.2 Az Oktatási Célú Szoftvertermékek (amint az a 16.3 pontban meghatározásra kerül), Kiadás Előtti
Szoftverek (amint az a 16.2 pontban meghatározásra kerül), a Szoftver nem kereskedelmi célú
példányai vagy az Adobe kötetengedély-programon keresztül szerzett Szoftverek kivételével, továbbá
tekintettel a 4.6.3 pontra, a Vásárló tartósan átadhatja a szoftverhasználati jogait másik
magánszemélynek vagy jogi személynek, amennyiben: (a) szintén átruházásra kerül (i) a jelen
Szerződés, (ii) a sorozatszám(ok), az Adobe vagy az Adobe engedélyezett forgalmazója által nyújtott
kommunikációs eszközhöz mellékelt Szoftver és a Szoftverrel együtt kínált, csomagolt vagy előtelepített
minden más Szoftver vagy hardver, beleértve a másolatokat, Frissítéseket és a korábbi változatokat (az
alábbi 5 szakasz értelmében), valamint (iii) a betűkészlet-szoftvereknek az adott magánszemély vagy
jogi személy részére készített másolatai; (b) nem őriz meg a számítógépben Frissítéseket vagy
másolatokat, a biztonsági másolatokat és egyéb példányokat is beleértve; illetve, ha (c) az a személy,
akire átruházták, elfogadja a jelen Szerződés feltételeit és minden olyan feltételt, amelynek alapján a
Vásárló érvényes engedélyt szerzett a Szoftverre. További információ a kötetfelhasználói szoftver
átruházásáról a következő oldalon található: http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_hu.
4.6.3 Ha a Szoftver rendszeres aktiválást vagy regisztrációt igényel, és a Vásárló kérésére az Adobe
felmenti a Vásárlót a rendszeres aktiválás vagy regisztráció kötelezettsége alól, akkor az Aktiválási
feltételekben (amint azok a 14.3 pontban meghatározásra került) írt megszorításokon kívül a 4.6.2
pontban közölt nem törlődő átruházás azonnal megszűnik a kérés teljesítésével.
4.7 Szolgáltatásokat nyújtó vállalkozások kizárása. A Vásárló a Szoftvert nem használhatja és nem
ajánlhatja szolgáltatásként. A 16.6.3 pont kizárólag a betűkészlet-szoftverre vonatkozó korlátozott
kivételt tartalmaz.
4.8 Adobe Runtime Korlátozások. A Vásárló nem jogosult az Adobe Runtime-okat nem PC egységen
vagy bármely más beágyazott vagy készülék verziójú operációs rendszeren használni. A kétségek
elkerülése végett és kizárólag példaként említve, Adobe Runtime nem használható (a) mobil
eszközökön, set-top-boxokban, kézi készülékeken, telefonokon, játékkonzolokon, TV-ken, DVD-
lejátszókon, médiaközpontokon (kivéve az XP Media Center Editiont és annak tartozékait), elektronikus
hirdetőtáblákon vagy más digitális megjelenítőkön, internetes eszközökön vagy az Internethez
kapcsolódó eszközökön, PDA-kon, orvosi eszközökön, ATM-eken, játékgépeken, házi automata
rendszerekben, kioszkban, távirányítású egységekben vagy bármilyen más fogyasztói elektromos
egységekben, (b) operátor alapú mobil, kábeles, műholdas, vagy televíziós rendszerekben, vagy (c) más
zárt rendszerű eszközökön. További információt az Adobe Runtime használatának engedélyezéséről a
következő oldalon talál: http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_hu.
4.9 Terület. Vásárló a Szoftvert és az Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokat kizárólag a Területen használja, és
kizárólag oly módon, ami megfelel a http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_hu oldalon található
aktiválási irányelveknek. Adobe megszüntetheti az ez úton átadott licencet, illetve felfüggesztheti a
Tagságot vagy az Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokhoz való hozzáférést, amennyiben Adobe megállapítja,
hogy Vásárló a Szoftvert vagy Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokat a Területen kívül használja.
--- Page 236 ---
5. Frissítések.
Amennyiben a Szoftver az Adobe Szoftver valamely korábbi verziójának (a „Korábbi Verzió”) frissítése,
akkor a Vásárló csak abban az esetben használhatja ezt a Frissítést, ha a Korábbi Verziót is megtartja.
Ennek megfelelően amennyiben Vásárló a Frissítést a 4.6 pont szerint érvényesen másra ruházza, a
Korábbi Verziót is át kell adnia azzal együtt. Amennyiben a Vásárló ezt a Frissítést a Korábbi Verzióval
együtt használni szeretné, ezt csak azon a Számítógépen teheti meg, amelyen a Korábbi Verziót
telepítette, illetve használja. Az Adobe Korábbi Verziókkal kapcsolatos támogatási kötelezettségei a
Licencidő alatt az adott Frissítés elérhetővé válásával megszűnhetnek. A Frissítés semmilyen más
módon nem használható. Az Adobe az újabb Frissítések engedélyezésekor további vagy eltérő
feltételeket köthet ki.
6. Korlátozott jótállás.
Ha másképp nem rendelkezik az Adobe és a Szoftver Engedélyes között létrejött külön szerződés, az
Adobe szavatolja olyan magánszemély vagy jogi személy számára, aki először vásárol használati
engedélyt a Szoftverre a jelen Szerződés feltételeinek értelmében, hogy a Szoftver lényegében a
hozzátartozó felhasználói kézikönyvnek megfelelően fog működni (a) a Szoftver átvételét követő 90
(kilencven) napos perióduson át, vagy (b) a Licencidő alatt, amelyik a kettő közül rövidebb, amennyiben
Kompatibilis Számítógépen használják. Amennyiben a Szoftver működése nem tér el lényeges
mértékben a felhasználói kézikönyvtől, a jótállás nem érvényesíthető. Ez a korlátozott jótállás nem
vonatkozik a „megtekintett állapotban”, Adobe-jótállás nélkül rendelkezésre bocsátott következő
elemekre: (i) javítóprogramok; (ii) betűkészlet-szoftver; (iii) a Szoftver kiadás előtti, próba-, induló,
értékelési és termékminta-, illetve nem kereskedelmi célú példányai; (iv) honlapok, Adobe Online
Szolgáltatások; harmadik felek által nyújtott online szolgáltatások; (v) hitelesített dokumentum-
szolgáltatások (lásd a 16 pontot); valamint (vi) az Adobe által ingyenesen rendelkezésre bocsátott, az
Adobe valamely internetes oldaláról letöltött minden szoftver. A jótállási igényeket a vásárlást igazoló
dokumentumokkal együtt, a Jótállási Időn belül kell benyújtani az Adobe Ügyfélszolgálati Részlegéhez
(Adobe Customer Support Department). További információt az jótállási igényekkel kapcsolatban a
következő oldalon talál: http://www.adobe.com/go/support_hu. Az Adobe-nak és vállalkozásainak
teljes felelőssége az ilyen jótállási igényekkel kapcsolatban, valamint a Vásárló egyetlen és kizárólagos,
bármely jótállás szerinti jogorvoslata az alábbi lehetőségek közül az egyikre korlátozódik az Adobe
választása szerint: a jótállási igény alapján a Szoftver támogatása, a Szoftver kicserélése, vagy,
amennyiben az Adobe meghatározása szerint sem a támogatás, sem a csere nem lehetséges, visszafizeti
a Vásárló által a Szoftverért fizetett díjat (amennyiben volt ilyen). A JELEN PONTBAN RÖGZÍTETT
KORLÁTOZOTT SZAVATOSSÁG MEGHATÁROZOTT JOGOKAT BIZTOSÍT A VÁSÁRLÓNAK. A TÖRVÉNY
TOVÁBBI JOGOKKAL IS FELRUHÁZHATJA A VÁSÁRLÓT, DE EZEK JOGHATÓSÁGONKÉNT ELTÉRŐK
LEHETNEK. AZ ADOBE NEM KÍVÁNJA A JOGSZABÁLYBAN MEGENGEDETT MÉRTÉKEN TÚLMENŐEN

történő – megszűnését követően is hatályban maradnak, de ez nem vonja maga után azt, illetve ez
alapján nem lehet folytatólagos jogot támasztani arra, hogy a Szoftvert a jelen Szerződés megszűnését
követően is használhassák.

Adobe gondatlansága vagy megtévesztő vétkes (csalárd) cselekménye idézett elő. Az Adobe jár el
kapcsolt vállalkozásai, beszállítói és a Tanúsító Szervezetek nevében a kötelezettségek, szavatosságok,
valamint a kártérítési felelősség kizárása és korlátozása érdekében, de csak a fent írt tekintetben és
célokból.
A FENTI KORLÁTOZÁSOK ÉS KIZÁRÁSOK A VÁSÁRLÓ ÁLLAMÁBAN IRÁNYADÓ JOGSZABÁLYOK
ÁLTAL MEGENGEDETT MÉRTÉKIG ALKALMAZHATÓK. ELŐFORDULHAT, HOGY EZ A
FELELŐSSÉGKORLÁTOZÁS EGYES JOGHATÓSÁGOK ALATT NEM ÉRVÉNYES. A VÁSÁRLÓNAK
LEHETNEK OLYAN JOGAI, AMELYEK ALÓLI MENTESÍTÉS A FOGYASZTÓVÉDELMI VAGY EGYÉB
JOGSZABÁLYOK ÉRTELMÉBEN NEM LEHETSÉGES. AZ ADOBE NEM KÍVÁNJA A JOGSZABÁLYBAN
MEGENGEDETT MÉRTÉKEN TÚLMENŐEN KORLÁTOZNI A VÁSÁRLÓ SZAVATOSSÁGI JOGAIT VAGY
JOGORVOSLATI LEHETŐSÉGEIT. A JOGHATÓSÁGRA VONATKOZÓ RENDELKEZÉSEK TEKINTETÉBEN
LÁSD A 16 PONTOT.
9. Kiviteli szabályok.
A vásárló elismeri, hogy a Szoftver az Egyesült Államokban érvényes exportszabályozási törvények (a
továbbiakban: („Exporttörvények”)) hatálya alá tartozik, és hogy köteles ezeket betartani. Ezért a vásárló
sem közvetlenül, sem közvetett módon nem exportálhatja és nem reexportálhatja a Szoftvert olyan:
(a) olyan országokba, amelyek az Egyesült Államok exportkorlátozásainak hatálya alá esnek (például –
de nem kizárólag – Kuba, Irán, Észak-Korea, Szudán és Szíria); (b) olyan végfelhasználóknak, akikről a
--- Page 238 ---
Vásárló tudja vagy okkal feltételezheti, hogy a Szoftvert nukleáris, vegyi vagy biológiai fegyverek,
rakétarendszerek, űrjárművek, kémrakéták vagy pilóta nélküli légi járművek tervezéséhez,
kifejlesztéséhez vagy gyártásához kívánják felhasználni; továbbá (c) olyan végfelhasználóknak, akik az
Egyesült Államok kormányának bármely szövetségi ügynöksége által eltiltattak az Egyesült Államok
exporttranzakcióiban való részvételtől. A vásárló felelősséggel tartozik továbbá azért, hogy saját
joghatósága minden olyan helyi törvényét betartsa, amely a Szoftver importjára, exportjára vagy
használatára vonatkozhat. Ha az Adobe tudomást szerez arról, hogy ilyen jogsértés történt, megszűnhet
a Szoftver karbantartási és támogatási szolgáltatása.
10. Irányadó jog.
Ha a Vásárló olyan vásárló, aki a Szoftvert kizárólag személyes, nem üzleti céljaira használja, akkor a
jelen megállapodásra a Szoftver licencének megvásárlási helye szerinti ország joghatósága vonatkozik.
Ha a Vásárló nem ilyen vásárló, akkor a jelen Szerződésre és annak értelmezésére az alábbi államok
hatályban lévő anyagi jogi szabályai irányadók: (a) Kalifornia Állam, amennyiben a Szoftvert az Egyesült
Államok, Kanada vagy Mexikó területén; (b) Japán, amennyiben Japánban; (c) Szingapúr, amennyiben a
Dél-Kelet-Ázsiai Nemzetek Szövetségéhez tartozó államok valamelyikében, a szárazföldi Kínában,
Hongkongban vagy Makaón, Tajvanon vagy a Koreai Köztársaságban; illetve (d) Anglia, amennyiben a
licencet a fentieken kívüli bármely országban vásárolta. Ha a kaliforniai jog az irányadó, akkor Santa
Clara megye megfelelő bíróságai (Kalifornia), ha a japán jog az irányadó, akkor a Tokió Kerületi Bíróság
(Japán), valamint ha az angol jog az irányadó, akkor az illetékes londoni bíróságok, (Anglia és Wales)
nem kizárólagos illetékességgel rendelkeznek a jelen Szerződéssel kapcsolatos jogviták tekintetében.
Szingapúri illetékesség esetén minden olyan vitát, amely a jelen megállapodásból fakadóan vagy azzal
kapcsolatban felmerül – beleértve például a megállapodás fennállásával, érvényességével vagy
felmondásával kapcsolatos vitákat is –, a szingapúri döntőbíróság elé kell vinni, és ennek végzését kell
elfogadni a Szingapúri Nemzetközi Döntőbírósági Központ (Singapore International Arbitration Centre,
SIAC) érvényben lévő döntőbíráskodási szabályainak megfelelően, melyeket referenciaként a jelen
szakasznak is tartalmaznia kell. A döntőbíró személyét – egy főt – a feleknek közösen kell kiválasztaniuk.
Amennyiben a döntőbíró személyében a keresetet benyújtó fél írásbeli igényét követő harminc (30)
napon belül nem sikerül megegyezni, a döntőbírót a SIAC elnöke jelöli ki. A döntőbíráskodás nyelve az
angol. Jelen megállapodás minden rendelkezésétől függetlenül – jogai és érdekei megőrzése, valamint
bizonyos konkrét, ideiglenes jogorvoslatra alkalmas feltételek betartatása céljából – mind az Adobe,
mind a Vásárló felkérhet bármely bíróságot, közigazgatási szervet vagy egyéb hatóságot bármely, a jogi
vagy döntőbíráskodási eljárás megkezdése előtti vagy azzal párhuzamos ideiglenes vagy tartós
intézkedés, például gyorsított bírósági beavatkozás, maradéktalan teljesítés vagy egyéb méltányos
jóvátétel elrendelésére. Jelen megállapodásra nem vonatkoznak a következők, melyek alkalmazása
kifejezetten kizárt: (x) bármely joghatóság jogszabályainak konfliktusa, (y) az Egyesült Nemzetek
Egyezménye a Nemzetközi Áruértékesítési Szerződésekről, valamint (z) az Egységes Számítógépes
Információtovábbítási Tranzakciós Törvény (Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act).
11. Általános rendelkezések.
Ha a jelen Szerződés bármely része érvénytelennek vagy kikényszeríthetetlennek bizonyul, ez nem
érinti a jelen Szerződés többi részének érvényességét, amely feltételeinek megfelelően érvényes és
kikényszeríthető marad. A jelen Szerződés csak írásban és az Adobe felhatalmazott tisztségviselője által
aláírva módosítható. Jelen megállapodás értelmezése vagy magyarázata során annak angol nyelvű
változata az irányadó. A jelen Szerződés az Adobe és a Vásárló között a Szoftverrel kapcsolatban
létrejött teljes megállapodás, és felvált a Szoftverre vonatkozóan ezt megelőzően tett minden
nyilatkozatot, megbeszélést, kötelezettségvállalást, közlést és nyilvánosságra hozatalt.
--- Page 239 ---
12. Megjegyzés az USA kormányzati végfelhasználói részére.
12.1 Az Adobe Technológia engedélyezése az USA kormányzata részére. A Vásárló vállalja, hogy az
Adobe Szoftver USA kormányzat vagy vállalkozója általi megvásárlásának engedélyezése során az
engedélyt a 48 C.F.R. cikkely 12.212 (polgári kormányhivatalok esetében) pontjában valamint a 48
C.F.R. cikkely 227.7202-1 és 227.7202-4 (Védelmi Minisztérium esetében) pontjaiban rögzített
szabályok szerint adja. Az USA kormányzati végfelhasználók esetében az Adobe vállalja, hogy eleget
tesz a vonatkozó esélyegyenlőségről szóló jogszabályoknak, ideértve – amennyiben alkalmazható – a
módosított 11246 sz. kormányrendelet rendelkezéseit, a vietnami háborús veteránok beilleszkedését
elősegítő 1974 évi törvény 402 §-át (38 USC 4212), a módosított 1973 évi rehabilitációs törvény 503
§-át, továbbá a 41 CFR 60-1-től 60-60-ig terjedő részét, valamint a 60-250 és 60-741 részekben foglalt
szabályokat. Az előző mondatban foglalt, hátrányos helyzetűek negatív megkülönböztetése ellenzéséről
rendelkező pont és szabályok a jelen Szerződésbe utalás révén beleértendők.
12.2 Kereskedelmi tételek. Az Egyesült Államok kormányzati felhasználói számára a Szoftver és a
Dokumentáció a 48 C.F.R. cikkely 2.101 szakasza értelmében vett „Kereskedelmi Árucikk”-nek
minősülnek, amely – értelemszerűen – a 48 C.F.R. cikkely 12.212 vagy 227.7202 szakaszában említett
„Kereskedelmi Számítógépes Szoftver”-t, illetve „Kereskedelmi Számítógépes Szoftverdokumentáció”-t
foglalja magába. A 48 C.F.R. cikkely 12.212, illetve 227.7202-1 és 227.7202-4 pontjainak értelemszerűen
megfelelve, az USA Kormányzati végfelhasználói a Kereskedelmi Számítógépes Szoftverre és a
Kereskedelmi Számítógépes Szoftverdokumentációra vonatkozó engedélyt az alábbiak szerint kapják:
(a) csak Kereskedelmi Árucikként és (b) csak azokkal a jogokkal együtt, amelyet a jelen szerződés
feltételeinek megfelelően minden egyéb végfelhasználó is megkap. A kiadatlan művekre vonatkozó
jogokat az Egyesült Államok szerzői jogi törvényei alapján fenntartjuk.
13. Engedélyeknek való megfelelés.
Ha a Vásárló vállalkozó, társaság vagy szervezet, akkor a Vásárló hozzájárul ahhoz, hogy a Szoftver által
végzett megfelelési ellenőrzések mellett tizenkét (12) havonta legfeljebb egyszer az Adobe vagy
felhatalmazott képviselője az előzetesen Vásárlónak küldött értesítést követő hét (7) munkanapon belül
átvizsgálja a Vásárló dokumentumait, rendszereit és eszközeit, ellenőrizve, hogy a Vásárló Adobe
szoftvereinek vagy szolgáltatásainak használata összhangban áll-e az Adobe-tól kapott engedélyekkel.
Például az Adobe jogosult megvizsgálni a Vásárló azon feljegyzéseit, amelyekből megállapítható, hogy a
Szoftver telepítései sorozatszámmal történtek-e, a Vásárló pedig köteles az ilyen feljegyzéseket az
Adobe kérését követően haladéktalanul a rendelkezésére bocsátani. Ezenkívül a Vásárló köteles az
Adobe kérését követő harminc (30) napon belül ellátni az Adobe-ot minden olyan feljegyzéssel és
információval, melyet az Adobe annak meghatározása érdekében kér, hogy a Vásárló által használt
Adobe szoftverek felhasználási módja megfelel-e a Vásárló által birtokolt érvényes licenceknek. További
információt a sorozatszámozással kapcsolatban a következő oldalon talál:
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_hu.
14. Internetcsatlakozási lehetőség és adatvédelem.
14.1 Automatikus kapcsolódás az Internethez. A Szoftver további jelzés nélkül automatikusan
csatlakoztathatja a Vásárló Számítógépét az Internethez és az Adobe honlapjához vagy doménjéhez
többek között olyan célokból, mint licencérvényesítés, vagy hogy további információkat, funkciókat
vagy funkcionalitásokat bocsáthasson a Vásárló rendelkezésére. Ha a 14.2 – 14.7 pontok másképp nem
rendelkeznek, a következő rendelkezések alkalmazandók a Szoftver által létrehozott minden
automatikus internetkapcsolatra:
14.1.1 Amikor a Szoftver – akár automatikusan, akár a felhasználó kifejezett kérésére – kapcsolódik az
Internetre és valamely Adobe-honlappal kommunikál, az Adobe Adatvédelmi Szabályzata
alkalmazandó. Az Adobe Adatvédelmi Szabályzata lehetővé teszi a felkeresett honlapok nyomon
követését, és részletesen tárgyalja a nyomon követés és a cookie-k, webes irányjelzők és hasonló
eszközök használatának kérdését.
--- Page 240 ---
14.1.2 Minden alkalommal, amikor a Szoftver az Adobe-hoz csatlakozik az Interneten keresztül,
bizonyos Vásárlóval kapcsolatos információkat gyűjt és ad át az Adobe-nak az Adobe Online
Adatvédelmi Szabályzatának megfelelően, mely elérhető a http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_hu
oldalon („Adatvédelmi Szabályzat”).
14.1.3 Ha a Vásárló hozzáfér az Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokhoz (mint azt alább a 16.4 pont
meghatározza), vagy aktiválja vagy regisztrálja a Szoftvert, az Adobe további információkat – úgymint a
Vásárló Adobe azonosítója, felhasználóneve és jelszava – kap meg és tárol el az Adatvédelmi Szabályzat
és az ilyen Adobe Online Szolgáltatásokhoz kapcsolódó további használati feltételek betartása mellett
(az Adobe.com feltételeivel és bármely más vonatkozó feltételekkel együttesen: „Kiegészítő
Felhasználási Feltételek”).
14.1.4 Amint azt a hatályos jogszabályok engedélyezik vagy a Vásárló elfogadta, az Adobe (a) küldhet a
Vásárlónak tranzakciós üzeneteket az Adobe Online Szolgáltatások előmozdítására vagy a Szoftver vagy
az Adobe Online Szolgáltatások aktiválásához vagy regisztrálásához, vagy (b) küldhet termékeken belüli
marketingüzeneteket, melyekkel információt szolgáltat a Szoftverrel vagy más Adobe termékekkel és
Szolgáltatásokkal kapcsolatban többek között olyan információ felhasználásával, mint platform verzió,
Szoftver verziója, licenc státusza és nyelv.
14.2 Frissítés. A Szoftver automatikusan, további jelzés nélkül (időszakosan vagy rendszeresen),
csatlakoztathatja Vásárló Számítógépét az Internethez (a) a letölthető és a Számítógépre telepíthető
Frissítések keresése érdekében, (b) hogy tájékoztassa az Adobe-ot a telepítési kísérletek eredményéről.
14.3 Aktiválás. A Szoftver megkövetelheti a Vásárlótól, hogy (a) szerezzen be Adobe azonosítót,
(b) aktiválja vagy újraaktiválja a Szoftvert, (c) regisztrálja a Szoftvert, vagy (d) érvényesítse a Tagságát. E
követelmények automatikusan, értesítés nélkül csatlakoztathatják a Vásárló Számítógépét az
Internethez telepítéskor, futtatáskor, és a későbbiekben rendszeres gyakorisággal. Csatlakozás után a
Szoftver információkat gyűjt és továbbít az Adobe-nak, amint az a
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_hu („Aktiválási Feltételek”) oldalon részletesen olvasható. A
Szoftver vagy a Vásárló kaphat továbbá információkat az Adobe-tól a Vásárló licencére, előfizetésére
vagy Tagságára vonatkozólag. Az Adobe az ilyen információt az érvényes licenc, előfizetés vagy Tagság
elvárásainak meg nem felelő, csalárd, jogszerűtlen használat észrevételezésére és megelőzésére
használja. A Szoftver aktiválásának vagy regisztrálásának, illetve a Tagság-előfizetés érvényesítésének
elmulasztása, vagy az Adobe által megállapított csalárd vagy nem jogszerű Szoftverhasználat a Szoftver
csökkentett működését vagy nem működtethetőségét, illetve az előfizetés vagy Tagság megszüntetését
vagy felfüggesztését eredményezheti.
14.4 Deaktiválás. Vásárló deaktiválhatja és eltávolíthatja a Szoftvert a Számítógépéről azzal a céllal, hogy
jelen megállapodással összhangban egy másik Számítógépre telepíthesse („Deaktiválás”), amint az
részletesebben olvasható a http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_hu oldalon. A Deaktiváláshoz
internetkapcsolat szükséges.
14.5 Az Online Szolgáltatások használata. A Szoftver automatikusan, további jelzés nélkül, időszakosan
vagy rendszeresen csatlakoztathatja a Vásárló Számítógépét az Internetre, hogy megkönnyítse az Adobe
vagy harmadik felek által a Vásárló rendelkezésére bocsátott, a 16.4 pontban (Online Szolgáltatások)
részletesebben leírt tartalmakhoz és szolgáltatásokhoz való hozzáférést. Ezen túlmenően a Szoftver
további jelzés nélkül automatikusan kapcsolódhat az Internetre, hogy frissítse az e szolgáltatásoktól
letölthető anyagokat annak érdekében, hogy a Vásárló azonnal, akár kapcsolat nélküli üzemmódban is
hozzáférhessen azokhoz.
14.6 Digitális Tanúsítványok. A Szoftver digitális tanúsítványokat használ, hogy segítse a Vásárlót a
letöltött állományoknak (például alkalmazásoknak és tartalmaknak), valamint azok kibocsátóinak
azonosításában. Például az Adobe AIR digitális tanúsítványt használ, hogy segítsen a Vásárlónak
azonosítani az Adobe AIR alkalmazások kiadóit. Az Adobe Acrobat termékcsalád szintén használ
digitális tanúsítványokat a hordozható dokumentumformátumú („PDF”) dokumentumokban az
aláírásokhoz és az aláírások érvényesítéséhez, valamint a hiteles PDF dokumentumok érvényesítéséhez.
A Vásárló Számítógépe a digitális tanúsítvány érvényesítésekor csatlakozhat az Internethez.
--- Page 241 ---
14.7 Beállításkezelő. A Szoftver Flash Playert is magában foglalhat. A Flash Player elmenthet bizonyos
felhasználói beállításokat oly módon, hogy eltárolja őket a Vásárló Számítógépén, mint helyi megosztott
objektumot. Ezek a beállítások Számítógépen futó Flash Player példányhoz kapcsolódnak, lehetővé téve
a Vásárló számára, hogy saját maga állítsa be a valós idejű alkalmazások testre szabását. A Flash Player
Settings Manager megengedi e beállítások módosítását, beleértve azt is, hogy korlátozza a harmadik
feleket a helyi megosztott objektumok mentésében, vagy hogy engedélyezze harmadik felek tartalmai
részére a hozzáférés jogát a számítógép mikrofonjához és kamerájához. A Flash Player verzió
beállításainak konfigurálásával kapcsolatban bővebb tájékoztatást a
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_hu oldalon talál, ideértve azt is, hogy hogyan kell letiltani a
helyi megosztott objektumokat a Flash Player beállításkezelőjében. További információt a helyi
megosztott dokumentumokról a következő oldalon talál:
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_hu.
15. Egyenrangú hálózatok.
A Szoftver felhasználhatja a Vásárló helyi területi hálózathoz való kapcsolódását a más Adobe
szoftverekhez történő, további jelzés nélküli automatikus csatlakozásra, ennek során pedig jelezheti a
helyi területi hálózaton, hogy készen áll a más Adobe szoftverekkel való kommunikációra. Ezek a
kapcsolások továbbadhatják a Vásárló kapcsolatának IP címét a helyi hálózat számára.
16. Különleges rendelkezések és kivételek.
A jelen pont a Szoftver bizonyos komponenseire és bizonyos termékekre vonatkozóan különleges
rendelkezéseket, illetve a fenti feltételek tekintetében bizonyos kivételeket tartalmaz. Amennyiben a
jelen pontban foglalt bármely rendelkezés ütközik a jelen Szerződés egyéb feltételeivel, akkor a jelen
pontban megfogalmazott feltételek felülírják az egyéb feltételeket.
16.1 A sérelem kizárásáról szóló rendelkezések; Európai Gazdasági Térség; Kötelező megjegyzés
Ausztáliára.
16.1.1 A jelen Szerződés nem csorbítja semelyik – többek között fogyasztói minőségben eljáró – fél
törvényes jogait. Például Új-Zélandon azon fogyasztók tekintetében, akik személyes, háztartási vagy
otthoni használatra (nem üzleti célokra) szerzik be a Szoftvert, a jelen szerződés a fogyasztóvédelmi
garanciákról szóló törvény (Consumer Guarantees Act) hatálya alá esik.
16.1.2 Ha Vásárló a Szoftvert az Európai Gazdasági Térségben (EGT) vásárolta, huzamosabb ideig az
EU-ban tartózkodik és fogyasztónak minősül (azaz a Szoftvert személyes, nem üzleti célokra használja),
akkor vásárlására és szoftverhasználatára a 6. Pont (Korlátozott jótállás) nem alkalmazandó. Helyette az
Adobe a vásárlástól számított 2 évig szavatolja, hogy a Szoftver a vonatkozó felhasználói kézikönyvben
rögzített funkcionalitással rendelkezik (a „megállapodott funkcionalitások”), amennyiben azt
Kompatibilis Számítógépen használják. A megállapodás szerinti funkcionalitásoktól való nem lényeges
eltérésre nem lehet jótállási igényeket alapozni. A JELEN JÓTÁLLÁS NEM VONATKOZIK A SZOFTVER
KIADÁS ELŐTTI, PRÓBA-, INDULÓ VAGY TERMÉKMINTAKÉNT HASZNÁLT PÉLDÁNYAIRA, A
BETŰKÉSZLET-SZOFTVERRE, VAGY A VÁSÁRLÓ ÁLTAL VÉGREHAJTOTT VÁLTOZTATÁSOK MIATT
MŰKÖDŐKÉPTELEN SZOFTVERRE. Szavatossági igényének érvényesítéséhez e kétéves időszakon belül
a Vásárlónak értesítenie kell az Adobe Ügyfélszolgálatát, és be kell mutatnia a Szoftver vásárlását
igazoló bizonylatokat. Az Adobe ellenőrzi, hogy a Szoftverben van-e a hiba, illetve felhívja a Vásárló
figyelmét arra, ha a hiba oka a Szoftver helytelen telepítése (ebben az esetben az Adobe támogatást
nyújt a Vásárlónak). Ha a Szoftver hibás, a Vásárló kérheti az Adobe-tól a vételár visszatérítését vagy a
Szoftver javított, illetve helyettesítő példányát. A kérelmet a vásárlást igazoló bizonylatok kíséretében
kell benyújtani. Amennyiben a Vásárló jótállással kapcsolatos információit elfogadják, az Adobe teljesíti
a javított, illetve helyettesítő Szoftverre vonatkozó kérését, kivéve, ha ez az Adobe számára ésszerűtlen
eljárást jelentene, amely esetben visszatéríti a Vásárlónak a termék árát. A jótállással kapcsolatos
támogatásért, kérjük, lépjen kapcsolatba az Adobe Ügyfélszolgálatával.
--- Page 242 ---
Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy a 8 pont (Felelősségkorlátozás) rendelkezései továbbra is alkalmazandók a
Szoftver használatával kapcsolatban benyújtott kártérítési kérelmek esetében. Mindamellett az Adobe
felelősséget vállal a jelen Szerződés Adobe részéről történő megszegése esetén ésszerűen előrelátható
közvetlen veszteségekért. Javasoljuk, hogy a Vásárló tegyen meg minden ésszerű intézkedést a károk
elkerülése vagy enyhítése érdekében; különösképpen javasoljuk, hogy készítsen biztonsági másolatokat
a Szoftverről és saját számítógépen tárolt adatairól.
A jelen Szerződésnek, és különösen annak 16.1.2 pontjának célja, hogy leírja a Vásárlót abban az
esetben megillető (többek között jogszabályban előírt) jogokat, ha a Szoftver használata során gondjai
merülnének fel. Ha a Vásárló törvényben előírt jogai szélesebb körűek e leírásnál, a törvényben előírt
jogok alkalmazandók.
16.1.3 A jelen megállapodás egyik feltétele sem (ideértve a 4.4 pontot is) korlátozza a Szoftver
visszafejtésére vonatkozó bármely olyan le nem mondható jogot, amely Vásárlót az alkalmazandó jog
szerint megilletheti. Például, ha Vásárló az Európai Unióban (EU) tartózkodik, akkor a vonatkozó
jogszabályokban meghatározott bizonyos feltételek esetén lehet olyan joga, hogy visszafejtse a
Szoftvert, ha ez szükséges ahhoz, hogy elérje a Szoftver interoperabilitását egy másik szoftverrel, és
előzetesen írásban kérte Adobe-tól az ilyen működés eléréséhez szükséges információk szolgáltatását,
de az Adobe nem adta meg ezt a tájékoztatást. Az ilyen visszafejtést továbbá csak a Vásárló vagy olyan
személy végezheti, aki jogosult a Szoftvert a Vásárló nevében használni. Adobe jogosult ésszerű
feltételeket szabni az információ megadása előtt. Az Adobe által szolgáltatott vagy a Vásárló által a jelen
Szerződés alapján engedéllyel megszerzett bármely információt a Vásárló csak az itt meghatározott
célra használhatja, és nem adhatja át harmadik félnek, illetve nem használhatja fel olyan szoftver
készítéséhez, amely lényegében hasonló a Szoftver megjelenéséhez, illetve nem használható fel
semmilyen olyan cselekményhez, amely az Adobe vagy licencszolgáltatói szerzői jogát sérti.
16.1.4 Ha Vásárló Ausztráliában jutott hozzá a Szoftverhez, akkor a következő klauza érvényes a jelen
szerződésben foglalt bármilyen ellenkező értelmű rendelkezés ellenére:
AZ AUSZTRÁLIAI VÁSÁRLÓK FIGYELMÉBE:
A termékeinkhez olyan garancia jár, ami az ausztrál fogyasztóvédelmi törvény szerint nem zárható ki.
Ön jogosult cserére vagy visszatérítésre komoly meghibásodás esetén, illetve bármilyen más ésszerűen
előrelátható kár vagy veszteség kompenzációjára. Ön emellett jogosult az áru megjavíttatására vagy
kicseréltetésére, ha az áru minősége nem elfogadható, és a meghibásodás nem tekinthető komoly
meghibásodásnak. A szoftvertermékünkhöz emellett 90 napos garanciát ad az Adobe Systems Software
Ireland Limited, melynek irodája Írországban, a 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24 cím
alatt található, mint az a Szerződésben meghatározásra került. Ha a terméke nem felel meg a
Felhasználói dokumentációban foglalt jellemzőknek és funkcióknak az Önhöz történő kiszállítás utáni
90 napos periódusban, kérjük, hívja fel az Adobe Ügyfélszolgálatát a 1800 614 863 számon. Ehhez
készítse elő a termék adatait, a sorozatszámára és a vásárlást igazoló dokumentumokat. Kérhetik Öntől,
hogy jutassa vissza a szoftverterméket arra a címre, amit akkor Önnek megadunk, ebben az esetben a
visszaküldés költségét Önnek kell állnia. A jótállásból eredő kedvezmények kiegészítései minden más,
törvényből fakadó jognak és jogorvoslatnak.
16.2 A kiadás előtti Szoftverre vonatkozó további feltételek. Ha a Szoftver a kereskedelmi forgalomba
hozatal előtti változat vagy béta szoftver („Kiadás Előtti Szoftver”), akkor a jelen pontot kell alkalmazni.
A Kiadás előtti Szoftver nem tekinthető az Adobe végleges termékének, és olyan kisebb
programhibákat és egyéb problémákat tartalmazhat, amelyek rendszerhibát vagy más meghibásodást,
illetve adatvesztést okozhatnak. Előfordulhat, hogy az Adobe soha nem bocsátja kereskedelmi
forgalomba a Kiadás Előtti Szoftvert. Ha Vásárló a Kiadás Előtti Szoftvert olyan külön írásbeli szerződés
alapján kapta, mint például az Adobe Systems Incorporated licencmegállapodása a még forgalomba
nem hozott termékekre vonatkozóan, akkor a Vásárló Szoftverhasználatára is ez a szerződés az
irányadó. Az Adobe kérésére, illetve amikor az Adobe az adott Szoftvert kereskedelmi forgalomba
hozza, a Vásárlónak haladéktalanul vissza kell szolgáltatnia, vagy meg kell semmisítenie a Kiadás Előtti
Szoftver összes példányát. A KIADÁS ELŐTTI SZOFTVER SAJÁT KOCKÁZATRA HASZNÁLHATÓ.

az Adobe BrowserLab, az Adobe CS Review, a Business Catalyst, a Digital Publishing Suite, az
Acrobat.com, a Search for Help és a termékek üdvözlő képernyői. Egyes esetekben az Adobe Online
Szolgáltatások a Szoftveren belüli funkcióként vagy annak kiterjesztéseként jelenhetnek meg annak
ellenére, hogy azok honlapon tárolódnak. Az Adobe Online Szolgáltatáshoz való hozzáférés
megkövetelheti a Vásárlótól, hogy aktiválja a Szoftvert, szerezzen be Adobe azonosítót, fogadja el a
Kiegészítő Felhasználási Feltételeket, vagy külön díj megfizetését igényelheti az egyes Adobe Online
Szolgáltatáshoz való hozzáférés. Előfordulhat, hogy az Adobe Online Szolgáltatások nem érhetők el
minden nyelven vagy minden ország lakosai számára, és az Adobe bármikor és bármely okból
módosíthatja, illetve megszüntetheti bármely Adobe Online Szolgáltatás rendelkezésre állását. Az
Adobe fenntartja továbbá a jogot, hogy egy előzőleg díjmentesen kínált Adobe Online Szolgáltatáshoz
való hozzáférésért vagy annak használatáért díjat kezdjen el felszámítani. A 14 pont fontos
információkat tartalmaz az Internethez kapcsolódásról és a Vásárló adatainak védelméről. A 14 pont
rendelkezései értelmében, amikor a Szoftver Adobe Online Szolgáltatáshoz csatlakozik, az ilyen Adobe
Online Szolgáltatás igénybevételére nézve az Adobe Adatvédelmi Szabályzata
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_hu), az Adobe.com Használati Feltételek
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_hu), valamint az Önnek ekkor felajánlott Kiegészítő Felhasználási
Feltételek irányadók.
16.4.2 Harmadik felek által nyújtott szolgáltatások. A Szoftver megkönnyítheti a Vásárló számára az árut,
információkat, szoftvert vagy szolgáltatást kínáló harmadik felek által fenntartott honlapokhoz
(„Harmadik felek online szolgáltatásai”) való hozzáférést. Ilyen harmadik felek által nyújtott online
szolgáltatás lehet többek között a Kodak EasyShare Gallery fotótár. A bármely harmadik fél által nyújtott
online szolgáltatáshoz való hozzáférés és azok használata tekintetében az adott honlapon olvasható –
vagy az ilyen harmadik felek által nyújtott online szolgáltatásokhoz bármilyen egyéb módon tartozó –
feltételek, felelősségkizárások és felhívások az irányadók. Az Adobe nem ellenőrzi, és nem hagyja jóvá a
harmadik felek által nyújtott online szolgáltatásokat, és azokért nem vállal felelősséget. A harmadik
felek által nyújtott online szolgáltatásokkal kapcsolatos bármely ügylet, beleértve e felek adatvédelmi
szabályzatait és a Vásárló személyes adatainak általuk történő felhasználását, áruk és szolgáltatások
átadását/nyújtását és kifizetését, illetve az ilyen ügyletekkel kapcsolatos egyéb feltételeket, jótállásokat
vagy kijelentéseket, kizárólag a Vásárlóra és az adott harmadik félre tartozik. Előfordulhat, hogy a
harmadik felek által nyújtott online szolgáltatások nem érhetők el minden nyelven vagy minden ország
lakosai számára, és az Adobe bármikor és bármely okból módosíthatja, illetve megszüntetheti bármely
külső fél által nyújtott online szolgáltatás rendelkezésre állását.

Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) és Adobe Approved Trust List vendors („AATL”) külső
beszállítók (gyűjtőnéven: „Tanúsító Szervezetek”), vagy maga az Adobe adja ki.
16.5.2 Feltételek. A digitális tanúsítványokon alapuló vásárlás, használat és az azok iránti bizalom a
Vásárló és a Tanúsító Szervezet felelőssége. Mielőtt a Vásárló megbízik egy tanúsított dokumentumban,
digitális aláírásban vagy egy Tanúsító Szervezet szolgáltatásában, vizsgálja meg azokat az érvényes
feltételeket, amelyek alapján az adott Tanúsító Szervezet szolgáltatást nyújt, ideértve például az
előfizetési megállapodásokat, kölcsönös bizalmon alapuló megállapodásokat, a tanúsítás szabályaira és
gyakorlatára vonatkozó nyilatkozatokat. Az Adobe CDS- illetve AATL-beszállítóival kapcsolatban
bővebb információt a http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_hu, illetve a
http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_hu címen talál.
16.5.3 Tudomásulvétel. A Vásárló tudomásul veszi, hogy (a) konfigurációs vagy egyéb külső okokból
fakadóan a Szoftver érvényesként tüntetheti fel az aláírást akkor is, ha a digitális tanúsítványt a
valóságban már visszavonták, vagy az a hitelesítés végzése előtt lejárt; (b) a digitális tanúsítvány
biztonsága vagy integritása veszélybe kerülhet a dokumentumot aláíró fél, az érintett Tanúsító Szervezet
vagy valamely külső fél cselekedete vagy mulasztása folytán; és (c) a tanúsítvány a kibocsátó saját
kiadmánya is lehet, amelyet nem Tanúsító Szervezet adott ki. A VÁSÁRLÓ EGYEDÜL FELEL AZÉRT A
DÖNTÉSÉRT, HOGY MEGBÍZIK-E A TANÚSÍTVÁNYBAN. AMÍG A VÁSÁRLÓ NEM KAP ÍRÁSBELI
BIZTOSÍTÉKOT A TANÚSÍTÓ SZERVEZETTŐL, ADDIG SAJÁT KOCKÁZATÁRA HASZNÁLJA A DIGITÁLIS
TANÚSÍTVÁNYT.
16.5.4 Külső kedvezményezettek. A Vásárló elismeri, hogy bármely olyan Tanúsító Szervezet, amelynek
tanúsítványát elfogadta, a jelen Szerződésnek külső kedvezményezettje, aki a maga részéről ugyanolyan
jogokkal rendelkezik a jelen Szerződés érvényre juttatását tekintve, mint maga az Adobe.
16.5.5 Jogorvoslat. A Vásárló vállalja, hogy vétlennek tartja és kártalanítja az Adobe-ot és az érintett
Tanúsító Szervezetet (a feltételekben foglalt kifejezett rendelkezések kivételével) minden olyan anyagi
felelősségért, veszteségért, cselekedetért, kárért vagy követelésért (ideértve az ésszerű kiadásokat,
költségeket és jogi díjakat), amelyek a Szervezet szolgáltatásainak igénybevételével kapcsolatban vagy
azokkal összefüggésben, illetve azokban bízva keletkeztek, ideértve korlátozás nélkül: (a) a lejárt vagy
visszavont tanúsítványra történt hagyatkozást; (b) a tanúsítvány nem megfelelő ellenőrzését; (c) a
tanúsítvány oly módon történő használatát, amelyet a vonatkozó feltételek, a jelen Szerződés vagy a
vonatkozó jogszabályok nem engednek meg; (d) a kibocsátó szolgáltatásaira vagy tanúsítványaira
hagyatkozó, az adott körülmények között ésszerűtlen döntés meghozását; illetve (e) a szolgáltatásokra
vonatkozó feltételekben megkövetelt kötelezettségek teljesítésének elmulasztását.

készítettek („Adobe Presenter Run Time”) csak azzal a prezentációval, információval vagy tartalommal
használható, amelybe az be van ágyazva. A Vásárló nem jogosult az Adobe Presenter Run Time-ot
másként felhasználni, mint ahogy a prezentációban, információban vagy tartalomban megtalálható, és
köteles ezen prezentáció, információ vagy tartalom licencengedélyesét is erre kötelezni. Ezen
túlmenően a Vásárló nem jogosult az Adobe Presenter Run Time-ot módosítani, visszafejteni,
visszafordítani, és köteles a prezentáció, információ vagy tartalom licencengedélyesét is erre kötelezni.
16.12 Flash Builder – LiveCycle Data Services (LCDS) adatkezelő könyvtárral (Data Management
Library). Az Adobe Flash Builder tartalmazhatja az fds.swc könyvtárat. A Vásárló az fds.swc-t csak az
ügyféloldali adatkezelési kapacitások szolgáltatására használhatja, valamint output fájlként a Vásárló
által fejlesztett szoftveren belül, az alábbi feltételekkel: A Vásárló (a) nem használhatja az fds.swc-t
társítások vagy offline képességek engedélyezésére a szoftveren belül, és (b) nem építheti be az fds.swc-

ed aggiunta relativi alle informazioni fornite da Adobe al Cliente in qualsiasi momento, fatte salve le
relative disposizioni contenute in termini separati (collettivamente, “Aggiornamenti”).
2. Licenza software; Partecipazione.
2.1 Licenza software. Il presente Articolo 2.1 è applicabili ai Clienti che hanno acquistato una licenza al
Software ma non hanno acquistato una licenza o un servizio basato su partecipazione quale la
partecipazione a Creative Cloud (come descritto nell’Articolo 2.2).
2.1.1 Concessione in licenza. Subordinatamente al rispetto da parte del Cliente del presente Contratto e
del pagamento degli oneri di licenza applicabili, Adobe concede al Cliente una licenza non esclusiva e
limitata per installare e usare il Software (a) nel territorio o nella regione in cui il Cliente ha ottenuto il
Software da Adobe o rivenditore autorizzato di Adobe o come altrimenti esplicitamente dichiarato nella
Documentazione (“Territorio”), (b) per la durata di tale licenza (“Durata della licenza”), (c) entro lo
scopo del Tipo di licenza o per il Numero consentito di Computer compatibili del Cliente come
specificato nella Documentazione e (d) in modo coerente con i termini del presente Contratto e della
Documentazione applicabile. Salvo altrimenti indicato nel presente Contratto, nella Documentazione
applicabile o al momento dell’acquisto, la Durata della licenza sarà perpetua. Alla scadenza o
risoluzione della Durata della licenza, una parte o tutto il Software può cessare di funzionare senza
preavviso. Alla scadenza o risoluzione della Durata della licenza, il Cliente non potrà usare il Software a
meno che il Cliente non abbia rinnovato la licenza. La licenza qui concessa è integrata da specifiche
disposizioni nell’Articolo 16 relative all’uso di particolari prodotti e componenti applicabili che possono
essere inclusi nel Software quali il software per caratteri tipografici, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe
Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite e Adobe Runtime.
2.1.2 Tipi di licenza.
2.1.2.1 Software privo di numero di serie. Il Software o parti del Software, forniti senza un numero di
serie per la Durata della licenza, possono solo essere installati e usati su un numero qualsiasi di
Computer compatibili come parte di un piano di distribuzione aziendale per la validità della Durata
della licenza solo a titolo dimostrativo, di valutazione e formazione ed esclusivamente nel caso in cui i
File di uscita o qualsiasi altro materiale creato a seguito di tale utilizzo vengano usati solo a scopo
interno, non commerciale e non di produzione. IL SOFTWARE PRIVO DI NUMERO DI SERIE VIENE
FORNITO “COSÌ COME È”. L’ACCESSO E L’USO DI QUALSIASI FILE DI USCITA CON SOFTWARE PRIVO DI
NUMERO DI SERIE SONO ESCLUSIVAMENTE A RISCHIO DEL CLIENTE.
2.1.2.2 Software di valutazione. Il Software o parti del Software, forniti con un numero di serie e
designato per “scopi di valutazione” o altra designazione simile (ad esempio, Software o un numero di
serie fornito come “EVAL” con un contratto diverso) (“Software di valutazione”), possono solo essere
installati e usati sul Numero consentito di Computer compatibili per la Durata della licenza unicamente
a titolo dimostrativo, di valutazione e formazione, esclusivamente nel caso in cui i File di uscita o
qualsiasi altro materiale creato a seguito di tale utilizzo vengano usati a scopo interno, non commerciale
e non di produzione. IL SOFTWARE DI VALUTAZIONE VIENE FORNITO “COSÌ COME È”. L’ACCESSO E
--- Page 250 ---
L’USO DI QUALSIASI FILE DI USCITA CON IL SOFTWARE DI VALUTAZIONE È ESCLUSIVAMENTE A
RISCHIO DEL CLIENTE.
2.1.2.3 Edizione in abbonamento. Per il Software disponibile sulla base di un abbonamento (“Edizione in
abbonamento”), il Cliente può installare e usare l’Edizione in abbonamento solo sul Numero consentito
di Computer compatibili per la Durata della licenza. Subordinatamente al Numero consentito di
Computer per l’Edizione in abbonamento, Adobe può consentire al Cliente di installare e usare la
versione precedente più recente dell’Edizione in abbonamento e la versione attuale dell’Edizione in
abbonamento sul medesimo computer per la Durata della licenza. Il Cliente concorda che Adobe può
modificare il tipo di Software (ad esempio, componenti specifici, versioni, piattaforme, lingue e così via)
incluso nell’Edizione in abbonamento in qualsiasi momento e non sarà responsabile in qualsiasi modo
verso il Cliente per tali cambiamenti. L’accesso continuo all’Edizione in abbonamento richiede: (a) una
connessione a Internet ricorrente per attivare, rinnovare e convalidare la licenza, (b) la ricevuta dei
pagamenti ricorrenti per l’abbonamento di Adobe o del rivenditore autorizzato e (c) l’assenso del
Cliente ai termini dell’abbonamento e ad altri termini e condizioni disponibili all’indirizzo
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_it o al momento dell’acquisto. Se Adobe non riceve il
pagamento ricorrente per l’abbonamento o non può convalidare periodicamente la licenza, il Software
diventerà inattivo senza preavviso fino a che Adobe non riceverà il pagamento o convaliderà la licenza.
2.1.3 Utilizzo su Computer portatile o domestico. Subordinatamente alle limitazioni previste nel
successivo Articolo 2.1.4, l’utente primario del Computer sul quale il Software è installato in base
all’Articolo 2.1 (“Utente primario”) può installare una seconda copia del Software esclusivamente
per il proprio utilizzo su di un Computer portatile o su di un Computer situato presso la propria
abitazione, purché il Software sul Computer portatile o domestico non sia utilizzato
contemporaneamente al Software installato sul Computer primario.
2.1.4 Limitazioni all’Uso secondario per numero di licenze. Qualora il Software sia ottenuto ai sensi di un
programma multilicenza o contratto Adobe (ad esempio Adobe Volume Licensing) da qualsiasi
licenziatario che non sia un licenziatario in base ad una licenza per studenti, la seconda copia del
Software ottenuta ai sensi dell’Articolo 2.1.3 deve essere usata esclusivamente per il vantaggio e
l’attività commerciale di quel numero di licenze.
2.1.5 Doppia piattaforma di avvio. Il Software viene concesso in licenza per l’uso su una piattaforma del
sistema operativo specifico. Il Cliente deve acquistare una licenza separata per l’uso del Software su
ciascuna piattaforma del sistema operativo. Ad esempio, se il Cliente desidera installare il Software su
entrambe le piattaforme con sistema operativo Macintosh e Windows su un dispositivo dotato di
entrambe le piattaforme (ossia un computer a doppio avvio), il Cliente dovrà prima ottenere due licenze
separate per il Software. Questo vale anche se sullo stesso supporto fornito al Cliente sono installate
due versioni del Software, ciascuna concepita per una piattaforma del sistema operativo diversa.
2.1.6 Distribuzione dal server. Come consentito dalla Documentazione, il Cliente può copiare
un’immagine del Software su un Computer file server all’interno della Rete interna del Cliente (“Server”)
al fine di scaricare ed installare il Software sui Computer all’interno della stessa Rete interna per l’uso
previsto dal presente Articolo 2.
2.1.7 Utilizzo su Server.
2.1.7.1 Come consentito in un documento di acquisto separato o nella Documentazione e
subordinatamente alle restrizioni di licenza nel presente Contratto, il Cliente può installare il Software su
un Server solo allo scopo di consentire l’accesso e l’uso del Software a un individuo da un Computer
all’interno della stessa Rete interna (“Utente della rete”). L’Utente della rete che ha accesso a tale
Software sul Server viene definito “Utente software del server”. Il numero totale di Utenti software del
server (non il numero contemporaneo di utenti) non può eccedere il Numero consentito. Ad esempio,
se il Cliente ha acquistato 10 licenze del Software (il Numero consentito è 10) e il Cliente sceglie di
installare il Software su un Server, il Cliente potrà concedere l’accesso al Software solo a 10 Utenti
software del server (anche se il cliente può avere più di 10 Utenti della rete o meno di 10 utenti
contemporanei del Software).
--- Page 251 ---
2.1.7.2 Per chiarificare e a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, quanto indicato in precedenza non
consente al Cliente di installare o accedere al Software, direttamente o mediante comandi, dati od
istruzioni: (a) da o verso un Computer che non sia parte della Rete interna del Cliente, (b) per abilitare
gruppi di lavoro o servizi ospitati su Web, (c) da parte di qualsiasi utente o entità ad usare, scaricare,
copiare o altrimenti beneficiare delle funzionalità del Software a meno che non sia concesso in licenza
da Adobe, (d) come componente di un sistema, flusso di lavoro o servizio accessibile da un numero di
utenti superiore rispetto al Numero consentito o (e) per operazioni non attivate da un utente singolo
(ad esempio, l’elaborazione automatizzata da parte del server).
2.2 Partecipazione. Il presente Articolo 2.2 è applicabili ai Clienti che hanno acquistato una licenza
basata su partecipazione o servizio quale la partecipazione a Creative Cloud (collettivamente,
“Partecipazione”).
2.2.1 Servizi online Adobe relative alla Partecipazione. Subordinatamente alla continua conformità del
Cliente al presente Contratto e al pagamento degli oneri di partecipazione, se dovuti, Adobe concede al
Cliente il diritto non esclusivo, su tutto il Territorio e limitato per accedere e usare il Software e il relativo
Servizio online Adobe (come ulteriormente descritto all’Articolo 16.4.1) come parte della
Partecipazione, soggetto ai termini dichiarati nel presente Contratto e nei Termini d’uso aggiuntivi
(come definito nell’Articolo 14.1.3 seguente).
2.2.2 Licenza software relativa alla Partecipazione. Subordinatamente alla continua conformità del
Cliente al presente Contratto e al pagamento degli oneri di partecipazione, se dovuti, Adobe concede al
Cliente una licenza non esclusiva e limitata per installare e usare il Software: (a) nel Territorio,
(b) durante il periodo in cui la Partecipazione è attuale e attiva (“Durata della Partecipazione”) e (c) in
modo coerente con i termini del presente Contratto e della Documentazione applicabile. Alla scadenza
o risoluzione della Durata della Partecipazione, (x) una parte o tutto il Software può cessare di
funzionare senza preavviso e (y) il Cliente non potrà utilizzare il Software a meno che il Cliente non
abbia rinnovato la partecipazione. Tutti i termini relativi al Software in questione come dichiarato nel
presente Contratto rimarranno in effetto e saranno applicabili al Cliente e al suo uso di tale Software.
2.2.3 Restrizioni. Il Cliente accetta i seguenti termini e restrizioni aggiuntivi relativi alla Partecipazione:
(a) Adobe può modificare il tipo di Software (ad esempio, prodotti specifici, componenti, versioni,
piattaforme, lingue e così via) incluso nella Partecipazione in qualsiasi momento e non sarà
responsabile in qualsiasi modo verso il Cliente per tali cambiamenti, (b) al Cliente potrà essere richiesto
di connettersi a Internet e accedere in qualsiasi momento durante la Durata della Partecipazione, (c) il
Software può connettersi automaticamente a Internet per verificare la Partecipazione del Cliente senza
preavviso in qualsiasi momento e (d) il Cliente non può abilitare o consentire ad altri di usare il Software
come Cliente.
2.3 File di contenuto. Salvo diversa disposizione contenuta nei file “Leggimi”, nella Documentazione o
altre licenze che accompagnano i File di contenuto, il Cliente può usare, visualizzare, modificare,
riprodurre e distribuire i File di contenuto. Tuttavia, il Cliente non può distribuire separatamente i soli
File di contenuto (ad esempio in circostanze in cui i File di contenuto stessi costituiscano il valore
principale del prodotto che viene distribuito) e il Cliente non potrà vantare diritti sui marchi di fabbrica
nei File di contenuto o di opere da essi derivate. Niente qui dichiarato influisce sulla proprietà del
Software come dichiarato nell’Articolo 3.
2.4 Codice programmazione di esempio. Il Cliente può modificare la forma del codice sorgente di quelle
parti di tali programmi software identificate come codice di esempio, codice programmazione di
esempio, frammenti di codice, file di classi ActionScript o componenti di esempio (ciascuna, “Codice di
programmazione di esempio”) nella relativa Documentazione illustrativa esclusivamente ai fini di
configurazione, sviluppo e collaudo dei siti e applicazioni sviluppate usando i programmi software
Adobe; fermo restando che, comunque, al Cliente è permesso copiare e distribuire il Codice di
programmazione di esempio (modificato o meno) solo se sussistono tutte le seguenti condizioni:
(a) il Cliente distribuisce solo le versioni in codice oggetto compilate del Codice di programmazione di

accetta di risarcire, manlevare e difendere Adobe da e contro qualsiasi perdita, danno, disputa o
controversia, comprese le spese legali che sorgono o derivano dall’uso o distribuzione dell’applicazione
dell’utente.
2.5 Linguaggi di programmazione. Il Software può includere parti di ExtendScript SDK e Pixel Bender
SDK. Subordinatamente alle limitazioni contenute nell’Articolo 2, Adobe concede al Cliente una licenza
non esclusiva, non trasferibile, senza diritti di concessione di licenza per usare i componenti in
ExtendScript SDK e Pixel Bender SDK esclusivamente ai fini di sviluppo interno di programmi applicativi
concepiti per funzionare con i prodotti Adobe. Fatta eccezione per i casi espressamente indicati
nell’Articolo 2.5, non sarà consentito modificare o distribuire altre parti di ExtendScript SDK o Pixel
Bender SDK. Il Cliente accetta di risarcire, manlevare e difendere Adobe da e contro qualsiasi perdita,
danno, disputa o controversia, comprese le spese legali che sorgono o derivano dalla distribuzione.
2.6 Copie della Documentazione. Al Cliente è consentito effettuare copie della Documentazione per
utilizzo interno alla propria azienda in connessione con l’uso del Software, secondo quanto previsto da
questo contratto, limitandosi al numero di copie assolutamente necessario.
3. Titolarità di Diritti di proprietà intellettuale.
Il Software e tutte le copie che il Cliente effettua costituiscono proprietà intellettuale e appartengono ad
Adobe Systems Incorporated e ai suoi fornitori. La struttura, l’organizzazione ed il codice sorgente del
Software costituiscono importanti segreti industriali ed informazioni confidenziali di proprietà di Adobe

valere nei confronti del Servizio Assistenza Clienti di Adobe entro il Periodo di garanzia; la relativa
richiesta deve essere corredata dalla prova di acquisto. Informazioni aggiuntive sulle richieste in
garanzia sono disponibili all’indirizzo http://www.adobe.com/go/support_it. La responsabilità intera di
Adobe e delle sue affiliate relativamente a tale richiesta di garanzia e il solo ed esclusivo rimedio del
Cliente relativamente a qualsiasi garanzia sarà limitato, a discrezione di Adobe, al supporto del Software
sulla base della richiesta di garanzia, sostituzione del Software o, se supporto e sostituzione non sono
possibili in base alla decisione di Adobe, rimborso degli oneri di licenza pagati dal Cliente per il Software
(se applicabile). LA GARANZIA LIMITATA SPECIFICATA NEL PRESENTE ARTICOLO CONFERISCE AL
CLIENTE SPECIFICI DIRITTI. A TALI DIRITTI POSSONO AGGIUNGERSENE ALTRI IN BASE ALLE LEGGI

disposizioni contenute nell’Executive Order 11246, consolidato, Art. 402 del Vietnam Era Veterans
Readjustment Assistance Act (Legge sull’assistenza ed il reinserimento dei veterani del Vietnam)
del 1974 (38 USC 4212), ed Art. 503 del Rehabilitation Act (Legge sulla riabilitazione) del 1973,
consolidato, e le disposizioni contenute in 41 CFR Parti da 60-1 a 60-60, 60-250, e 60-741. La
--- Page 257 ---
clausola e le disposizioni su misure volte a favorire gli appartenenti a minoranze citate nella frase che
precede sono incorporate per riferimento nel presente Contratto.
12.2 Prodotti commerciali. Per gli Utenti finali del Governo degli Stati Uniti, il Software è un “Prodotto
commerciale” secondo la definizione contenuta in 48 C.F.R. Art. 2.101, costituiti da “Software
commerciale per Computer” e “Documentazione relativa a software commerciale per Computer”
secondo il modo in cui tali termini sono usati in 48 C.F.R. Art.12.212 o 48 C.F.R. Art. 227.7202, a seconda
dei casi. In conformità a 48 C.F.R. Art. 12.212 ovvero 48 C.F.R. Artt. da 227.7202-1 a 227.7202-4 incluso,

riservati in conformità alle leggi sul diritto d’autore degli Stati Uniti.
13. Conformità alla licenza d’uso.
Il Cliente si impegna, oltre a qualsiasi controllo della conformità eseguito dal Software, nel caso in cui si
tratti di un’impresa, una società od un’organizzazione, a consentire, con preavviso di sette (7) giorni
lavorativi e non più di una volta ogni dodici (12) mesi, ad Adobe o a un suo rappresentante autorizzato
di controllare i registri, i sistemi e le strutture onde verificare la conformità dell’utilizzo di qualsiasi
software Adobe alle valide licenze d’uso rilasciate da Adobe. Ad esempio, Adobe ha diritto di consultare
i record del Cliente utili per determinare se le installazioni del Software siano state o meno serializzate e,
su richiesta da parte di Adobe, il Cliente dovrà fornire immediatamente ad Adobe tali record. Inoltre, il
Cliente dovrà fornire ad Adobe tutti gli archivi e le informazioni richieste da Adobe per consentire che la
verifica dell’uso di qualsiasi Software Adobe sia in conformità con le licenze valide dell’utente ricevute
da Adobe entro trenta (30) giorni dalla richiesta di Adobe. Informazioni aggiuntive sulla serializzazione
sono disponibili all’indirizzo http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_it.
14. Connettività Internet e privacy.
14.1 Connessioni automatiche a Internet. Il Software può causare, senza preavviso, la connessione
automatica del Computer del Cliente a Internet, e la conseguente comunicazione con un sito Web o
dominio Adobe a fini quali convalida della licenza e la fornitura al Cliente di ulteriori informazioni,
funzioni e funzionalità. A meno che non sia specificato diversamente negli Articoli da 14.2 a 14.7, le
seguenti disposizioni valgono per tutte le connessioni automatiche a Internet dal Software:
14.1.1 Ogni volta che il Software effettua una connessione a Internet e comunica con un sito Web
Adobe, automaticamente o su esplicita richiesta dell’utente, verrà applicata l’Informativa sulla privacy.
L’Informativa Adobe sulla privacy consente di monitorare le visite al sito Web e spiega in dettaglio il
monitoraggio e l’uso di cookie, beacon Web e dispositivi simili.
14.1.2 Ogni qualvolta il Software si connette ad Adobe mediante Internet, determinate informazioni del
Cliente sono raccolte e trasmesse dal Software ad Adobe in conformità all’Informativa Adobe sulla
privacy online disponibile all’indirizzo http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_it (“Informativa sulla
privacy”).
14.1.3 Se il Cliente accede a un Servizio online Adobe (come definito all’Articolo 16.4 di seguito) o attiva
o registra il Software, possono essere trasmesse e memorizzate da Adobe informazioni aggiuntive quali
ID Adobe, nome utente e password del Cliente, in conformità all’Informativa sulla privacy e a termini
d’uso aggiuntivi relativi a tale Servizio online Adobe (unitamente ai termini d’uso e altri termini
applicabili di Adobe.com, i “Termini d’uso aggiuntivi”).
14.1.4 Come consentito dalla legge applicabile o come accettato dal Cliente, Adobe può (a) inviare al
Cliente messaggi transazionali per facilitare il Servizio online Adobe o l’attivazione o la registrazione del
Software o del Servizio online Adobe o (b) inviare marketing nel prodotto per offrire informazioni sul
--- Page 258 ---
Software e altri prodotti e Servizi Adobe, usando informazioni che comprendono, ma non sono limitate
a, versione di piattaforma, versione del Software, stato della licenza e lingua.
14.2 Aggiornamento. Il Software può far sì che il Computer del Cliente si colleghi automaticamente,
senza preavviso, ad Internet (a intermittenza o con frequenza regolare), per (a) verificare la presenza di
Aggiornamenti disponibili per il download e l’installazione sul Computer e (b) informi Adobe dei
risultati dei tentativi di installazione.
14.3 Attivazione. Il Software può richiedere al Cliente di (a) ottenere un ID Adobe, (b) attivare o
riattivare il Software, (c) registrare il Software o (d) convalidare la Partecipazione. Tale requisito può
causare la connessione del Computer del Cliente a Internet senza preavviso al momento
dell’installazione, all’avvio o regolarmente a partire da tale momento. Una volta connesso, il Software
raccoglierà e trasmetterà informazioni ad Adobe, come ulteriormente descritto in
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_it (“Termini di attivazione”). Il Software o il Cliente possono
anche ricevere informazioni da Adobe relative alla licenza, all’abbonamento o all’Appartenenza del
Cliente. Adobe può usare tali informazioni per rilevare o prevenire l’uso fraudolento o non autorizzato
in conformità con una licenza, un abbonamento o un’Appartenenza valida. La mancata attivazione o
registrazione del Software, convalida dell’abbonamento o dell’Appartenenza o la determinazione di
Adobe relativamente a uso fraudolento o non autorizzato del Software può risultare in funzionalità
ridotte, non funzionamento del Software o alla cessazione o alla sospensione dell’abbonamento o
dell’Appartenenza.
14.4 Deattivazione. Il Cliente può deattivare o disinstallare il Software dal Computer per poter installare
o attivare il Software su un altro Computer in conformità con il presente contratto (“Deattivazione”)
come ulteriormente descritto all’indirizzo http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_it. La Deattivazione
richiede la connettività a Internet.
14.5 Utilizzo dei Servizi online. Il Software può fare in modo che il Computer del Cliente, senza ulteriore
avviso e con frequenza intermittente o regolare, si colleghi automaticamente a Internet per facilitare
l’accesso del Cliente a contenuto e servizi offerti da Adobe o terze parti, come descritto in dettaglio
nell’Articolo 16.4 (Servizi online). Inoltre, senza ulteriore avviso, il Software potrebbe collegarsi
automaticamente a Internet al fine di aggiornare automaticamente tutto il materiale scaricabile da
questi servizi online per renderli disponibili immediatamente anche quando il Cliente è offline.
14.6 Certificati digitali. Il Software utilizza certificati digitali (come descritto all’Articolo 16.5) per
consentire al Cliente di identificare i file scaricati (ad esempio, applicazioni e contenuto) e i relativi
fornitori. Ad esempio, Adobe AIR usa certificati digitali per consentire al Cliente di identificare i fornitori
di applicazioni Adobe AIR. Anche la famiglia dei prodotti Adobe Acrobat utilizza certificati digitali per
firmare e convalidare le firme nei documenti Portable Document Format (“PDF”) e per convalidare i
documenti PDF certificati. Al momento della convalida di un certificato digitale, il Computer del Cliente
si può connettere ad Internet.
14.7 Programma di gestione impostazioni. Il Software può includere Flash Player. Flash Player può
salvare alcune impostazioni dell’utente memorizzandole sul Computer del Cliente sotto forma di
oggetto localmente condiviso. Questi sono associati all’istanza di Flash Player sul Computer,
consentendo al Cliente di personalizzare le funzionalità runtime. Il programma di gestione impostazioni
di Flash Player consente al Cliente di modificare tali impostazioni quali la possibilità di limitare terze
parti nel memorizzare oggetti localmente condivisi o concedere al contenuto di terze parti il diritto di
accedere al microfono e alla telecamera del computer. Ulteriori informazioni su come configurare la
versione in uso di Flash Player, compreso come disabilitare gli oggetti localmente condivisi nel
programma di gestione delle impostazioni di Flash Player, sono disponibili all’indirizzo
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_it. Informazioni aggiuntive sugli oggetti localmente
condivisi sono disponibili all’indirizzo http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_it.

15. Comunicazioni peer-to-peer.
Il Software può utilizzare la connessione del Cliente ad una rete LAN per collegarsi automaticamente e
senza ulteriore avviso ad altro software Adobe e così facendo può indicare sulla rete LAN di essere
disponibile per le comunicazioni con altro software Adobe. Queste connessioni possono trasmettere
l’indirizzo IP della connessione del Cliente sulla rete locale.
16. Disposizioni ed eccezioni specifiche.
Il presente articolo contiene specifiche disposizioni relative a determinati prodotti e componenti del
Software ed anche eccezioni limitate rispetto ai termini ed alle condizioni che precedono. In caso di
conflitto delle disposizioni contenute nel presente articolo con qualsiasi altro termine o condizione del
presente contratto, le disposizioni del presente articolo prevarranno.
16.1 Nessun pregiudizio; disposizioni dello Spazio economico europeo; avviso obbligatorio per
l’Australia.
16.1.1 Il presente contratto non pregiudica i diritti statutari previsti dalla normativa vigente a tutela dei
consumatori. Ad esempio, per i consumatori in Nuova Zelanda che hanno il Software in concessione per
uso personale, domestico o familiare (non per scopi commerciali), il presente contratto è soggetto al
Consumer Guarantees Act.
16.1.2 Se il Cliente ha acquistato il Software e risiede abitualmente nello Spazio ed è un consumatore
(vale a dire utilizza il Software per scopi personali e non a fini commerciali), l’Articolo 6 non è
applicabile all’acquisto e all’utilizzo del Software. Adobe garantisce invece che il Software offre le
funzionalità descritte nel manuale dell’utente applicabile (le “funzionalità concordate”) per un periodo
di 2 anni purché questo sia utilizzato sul Computer compatibile. Variazioni non sostanziali rispetto alle
funzionalità concordate non comporteranno un diritto di garanzia. LA PRESENTE GARANZIA NON SI
APPLICA AL SOFTWARE RICHIESTO DAL CLIENTE QUALE VERSIONE PRELIMINARE, COPIA DI PROVA,
STARTER, COPIA DIMOSTRATIVA OPPURE AL SOFTWARE PER CARATTERI TIPOGRAFICI OVVERO AL
SOFTWARE DIFETTOSO A CAUSA DI MODIFICHE APPORTATE DAL CLIENTE. Per fare valere la garanzia,
il Cliente deve inviare notifica al Servizio assistenza clienti di Adobe entro il periodo di due anni di
validità della garanzia, fornendo dettagli della prova di acquisto del Software. Adobe verificherà con il
Cliente se si tratti di un difetto del Software o di un problema di installazione non corretta (nel qual
caso, Adobe presterà la necessaria assistenza al Cliente). Qualora si tratti di un difetto Software, il Cliente
potrà richiedere da Adobe un rimborso o una copia riparata/sostitutiva del Software. Le richieste
devono essere accompagnate dalla prova di acquisto. Nel caso in cui i dettagli relativi alla garanzia del
Cliente vengano ritenuti validi, Adobe si impegna ad ottemperare alla richiesta di Software
riparato/sostitutivo del Cliente, tranne nel caso in cui ciò non risultasse ragionevole per Adobe, nel qual
caso Adobe provvederà a rimborsare il Cliente. Per assistenza sulla garanzia, rivolgersi al Servizio
Assistenza Clienti di Adobe.
Le disposizioni dell’Articolo 8 (Limitazione di responsabilità) saranno valide per qualunque richiesta di
danni presentata dal Cliente in relazione all’utilizzo del Software. Ciononostante, Adobe sarà
responsabile delle perdite dirette ragionevolmente prevedibili nell’eventualità di violazione del
presente contratto da parte di Adobe. Si consiglia al Cliente di prendere ogni ragionevole precauzione
per prevenire e limitare i danni, in particolare effettuando copie di backup del Software e dei dati
presenti sul proprio computer.
Questo contratto, e in particolare l’Articolo 16.1.2, contiene la descrizione dei diritti del Cliente (inclusi i
diritti statutari) nel caso in cui insorgessero problemi nell’uso del Software. Qualora i diritti statutari del
Cliente fossero maggiori di quelli contenuti nella presente descrizione, tali diritti statutari prevarranno.
16.1.3 Nulla di quanto contenuto in questo contratto (incluso l’Articolo 4.4) limiterà qualsiasi diritto non
rinunciabile a decompilare il Software disponibile secondo le leggi di pertinenza. Qualora ad esempio il
Cliente risieda in un Paese dell’Unione Europea (EU), il Cliente può disporre del diritto ad alcune
--- Page 260 ---
condizioni specificate dalle leggi di pertinenza a decompilare il Software, qualora necessario per
ottenere interoperabilità del Software stesso con un altro programma software, purché che il Cliente
richieda per iscritto ad Adobe di fornire le informazioni necessarie per ottenere tale interoperabilità e
che Adobe abbia reso disponibili tali informazioni. Inoltre, tale decompilazione potrebbe essere
eseguita solo dal Cliente o da persona con diritto d’uso della copia software a nome del Cliente. Adobe
ha il diritto di imporre ragionevoli condizioni prima di fornire tali informazioni. Qualsiasi informazione
fornita da Adobe o ottenuta dal Cliente come previsto in questa sede può solo essere usata dal Cliente
per il fine qui descritto e non può essere rivelata a terzi o usata per creare qualsiasi software che sia
sostanzialmente simile alla forma di espressione del Software o usata per qualsiasi altra azione che violi
il diritto di copyright di Adobe o dei suoi licenziatari.

2. Programvarelisens; Medlemskap.
2.1 Programvarelisens. Punkt 2.1 herunder gjelder Kunder som har anskaffet en lisens til Programvaren,
men ikke en medlemskapsbasert lisens eller tjeneste, slik som Creative Cloud-medlemskap (som
beskrevet under punkt 2.2).
2.1.1 Lisensbevilgning. Underkastet Kundens varige overholdelse av denne Avtalen og betaling av de
gjeldende lisensbeløpene, bevilger Adobe en ikke-eksklusiv og begrenset lisens til Kunden, til
installasjon og bruk av Programvaren (a) i territoriet eller regionen hvor Kunden erverver Programvaren
fra Adobe eller Adobes autoriserte forhandlere eller som på annen måte beskrevet i Dokumentasjonen
(«Territorium»), (b) i løpet av perioden lisensen gjelder («Lisensperiode»), (c) innenfor Lisenstypens
omfang og på de Tillatte Antall av Kundens Kompatible Datamaskiner som er spesifisert i
Dokumentasjonen, og (d) på en måte som overholder betingelsene i denne Avtalen og den gjeldende
Dokumentasjonen. Om det ikke er definert annerledes i denne Avtalen, i den gjeldende
Dokumentasjonen, eller ved kjøp, skal Lisensperioden være evigvarende. Ved opphør eller oppsigelse
av Lisensperioden kan deler av, eller hele, Programvaren slutte å fungere uten foregående meddelelse.
Ved opphør eller oppsigelse av Lisensperioden kan ikke Kunden bruke Programvaren med mindre
Kunden har fornyet Lisensen. Lisensen som er bevilget herunder er supplementert med spesifikke
bestemmelser under punkt 16 som relaterer til bruk av visse gjeldende produkter og komponenter som
kan være inkludert i Programvaren, som programvare for skrivetype, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe
Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite og Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 Lisenstyper.
2.1.2.1 Programvare uten serienummer. Programvaren, eller deler av den, som er levert uten
serienummer i løpet av Lisensperioden kan kun installeres og brukes på et ubegrenset antall
Kompatible Datamaskiner som del av en organisasjonsplan i løpet av Lisensperioden utelukkende til
demonstrasjon, evaluering og opplæringsformål, og kun dersom eventuelle Utdatafiler eller annet
materiale som blir laget ved slik bruk kun brukes til interne, ikke-kommersielle formål og ikke til
produksjon. PROGRAMVAREN UTEN SERIENUMMER ER LEVERT «SOM DEN ER». TILGANG TIL OG
BRUK AV EVENTUELLE UTDATAFILER SOM ER OPPRETTET MED PROGRAMVARE UTEN
SERIENUMMER SKJER UTELUKKENDE PÅ KUNDENS EGET ANSVAR.
2.1.2.2 Evalueringsprogramvare. Programvaren, eller deler av den, som er levert med serienummer
for «evaluering» eller lignende (for eksempel programvare eller serienummer som er levert som
«EVAL» underlagt særskilt avtale) («Evalueringsprogramvare») kan bare installeres og brukes på
Tillatt Antall av Kompatible Datamaskiner i løpet av Lisensperioden i forbindelse med demonstrasjon,
evaluering og opplæringsformål, og kun dersom eventuelle Utdatafiler eller annet materiale som blir
laget ved slik bruk kun brukes til interne, ikke-kommersielle formål og ikke til produksjon.
EVALUERINGSPROGRAMVAREN ER LEVERT «SOM DEN ER». TILGANG TIL OG BRUK AV
--- Page 309 ---
EVENTUELLE UTDATAFILER SOM ER OPPRETTET MED SLIK EVALUERINGSPROGRAMVARE, SKJER
UTELUKKENDE PÅ KUNDENS EGET ANSVAR.
2.1.2.3 Abonnementslisens. For Programvaren som er tilgjengelig gjennom abonnement
(«Abonnementslisens»), kan Kunden kun installere og bruke Abonnementslisensen på Tillatt Antall av
Kompatible Datamaskiner i løpet av Lisensperioden. Underkastet Tillatt Antall av Datamaskiner for
Abonnementslisensen, kan Adobe tillate at Kunden installerer og bruker den mest nylige versjonen av
Abonnementslisensen og den gjeldende versjonen av Abonnementslisensen på den samme
Datamaskinen i løpet av Lisensperioden. Kunden godtar at Adobe kan endre Programvaretypen (slik
som spesifikke komponenter, versjoner, plattformer, språk, etc.) som er inkludert i
Abonnementslisensen til enhver tid og skal ikke stilles ansvarlig overfor Kunden på noe område ved
slike endringer. Kontinuerlig tilgang til en «Abonnementslisens» krever: (a) periodisk Internettilgang for
å aktivere, fornye og bekrefte lisensen, (b) kvitteringer av periodiske abonnementsbetalinger fra Adobe
eller Adobes autoriserte forhandler, og (c) Kundens godtakelse av abonnementsvilkår og andre
tilleggsvilkår og -betingelser som er tilgjengelig på http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_no eller
ved kjøp. Dersom Adobe ikke mottar de periodiske betalingene eller ikke får periodisk bekreftet
lisensen, kan Programvaren deaktiveres uten ytterligere meddelelse til Adobe mottar betaling eller får
bekreftet lisensen.
2.1.3 Bruk av bærbar eller hjemmedatamaskin. I henhold til begrensningene som er fremsatt i
punkt 2.1.4, kan primærbrukeren av Datamaskinen som Programvaren er installert på under
punkt 2.1 («Primærbrukeren»), installere en ekstra kopi av Programvaren for hans eller hennes
eksklusive bruk på enten en Bærbar Datamaskin eller Hjemmedatamaskin så fremt Programvaren
på den Bærbare Datamaskinen eller Hjemmedatamaskinen ikke brukes samtidig som Programvaren
på primærmaskinen.
2.1.4 Restriksjoner på sekundær bruk av volumlisenstakere. Hvis Programvaren er ervervet underlagt et
volumlisensprogram eller -avtale fra Adobe (slik som Adobe Volume Licensing) av en annen lisenstaker
enn lisenstakere under volumlisenser for utdannelse, kan den ekstra kopien av Programvaren, i henhold
til punkt 2.1.3, kun benyttes innenfor rammen som følger av den aktuelle volumlisensens formål.
2.1.5 Dual Boot-plattform. Programvaren er lisensiert for bruk på en bestemt operativsystemplattform.
Kunden må kjøpe en separat lisens for å bruke Programvaren på hver operativsystemplattform. Hvis
Kunden for eksempel vil installere Programvaren både på Mac OS- og Windows-
operativsystemplattformer på en enhet som kjører begge plattformene (med andre ord en dual boot-
maskin), må Kunden først erverve to separate lisenser for Programvaren. Dette gjelder også hvis to
versjoner av Programvaren, som hver er designet for forskjellige operativsystemplattformer, er levert til
deg på de samme mediene.
2.1.6 Distribusjon fra en server. I samsvar med Dokumentasjonen, kan Kunden kopiere en avbildning av
Programvaren på Datamaskinens filserver i Kundens eget Intranett, med den hensikt å laste ned og
installere Programvaren på Datamaskiner i det samme Intranettet, kun for bruk som tillates i henhold til
punkt 2.
2.1.7 Server-bruk.
2.1.7.1 Kunden kan installere Programvaren på en Server kun for det formål å bevilge en person fra en
Datamaskin på det samme Intranettet («Nettverksbruker») tilgang til å bruke Programvaren i henhold
til det som er tillatt i et separat kjøpsdokument eller Dokumentasjon og lisensrestriksjonene i denne
Avtalen. Nettverksbrukeren som har tilgang til slik Programvare på Serveren blir referert til som
«Serverprogramvarebruker». Det totale antallet Serverprogramvarebrukere (ikke antall brukere
samtidig) skal ikke overstige Tillatt Antall. For eksempel, dersom Kunden har anskaffet 10
Programvarelisenser (tillatt antall er 10) og Kunden velger å installere Programvaren på en Server, kan
Kunden kun bevilge opp til 10 Serverprogramvarebrukere tilgang til Programvaren (selv om Kunden
har flere enn 10 Nettverksbrukere eller færre enn 10 samtidige brukere av Programvaren).
--- Page 310 ---
2.1.7.2 For oppklaring og uten begrensninger, tillater det foregående ikke at Kunden kan installere eller
ha tilgang til (enten direkte eller gjennom kommandoer, data eller anvisninger) Programvaren: (a) fra
eller til en Datamaskin som ikke er en del av ditt Intranett; (b) for muliggjøring av nettbaserte
arbeidsgrupper eller tjenester som er tilgjengelige for allmennheten; (c) av en hvilken som helst bruker
eller enhet å bruke, laste ned, kopiere, eller ellers dra nytte av Programvaren uten en gyldig lisens fra
Adobe; (d) som en komponent i et system, arbeidsflyt eller tjeneste som er tilgjengelig for flere enn det
Tillatte antall brukere; eller (e) for operasjoner som ikke er igangsatt av en individuell bruker (for
eksempel automatisert serverprosessering).
2.2 Medlemskap. Punkt 2.2 gjelder Kunder som har anskaffet medlemskapsbasert lisens eller tjeneste,
slik som Creative Cloud-medlemskap (fellesbetegnelse «Medlemskap»).
2.2.1 Adobe Online Services relatert til Medlemskapet. Underlagt Kundens varige overholdelse av
denne Avtalen og betalinger av de gjeldende medlemskapsbeløpene, om noen, bevilger Adobe til
Kunden en ikke-utelukkende, Territoriumsbestemt og begrenset rettighet til tilgang og bruk av
Programvaren og relaterte Adobe Online Service (som er videre beskrevet under punkt 16.4.1) som del
av Medlemskapet, underlagt betingelsene i denne Avtalen og de Ytterlige Bruksbetingelsene (som
definert under punkt 14.1.3 nedenfor).
2.2.2 Programvarelisens relatert til Medlemskapet. Underlagt Kundens varige overholdelse av denne
Avtalen og betalinger av de gjeldende medlemskapsbeløpene, om noen, bevilger Adobe til Kunden en
ikke-eksklusiv og begrenset lisens til å installere og bruke Programvaren: (a) i gitt Territorium, (b) i løpet
av perioden som Medlemskapet er aktivt («Medlemskapsperioden») og (c) på en måte som kan
forenes med betingelsene i denne Avtalen og gjeldende Dokumentasjon. Ved opphør eller oppsigelse
av Medlemskapsperioden, (x) kan deler av, eller hele, Programvaren slutte å fungere uten meddelelse
på forhånd og (y) kan ikke Kunden bruke Programvaren med mindre Kunden har fornyet
medlemskapet. Alle betingelser relatert til den spesifikke Programvaren som er beskrevet i denne
Avtalen, skal ha effekt og fortsette å gjelde for Kunden og dens bruk av slik Programvare.
2.2.3 Restriksjoner. Kunden godtar følgende ytterligere betingelser og restriksjoner relatert til
Medlemskapet: (a) Adobe kan endre Programvaretypen (som spesifikke produkter, komponenter,
versjoner, plattformer, språk, etc.) som er inkludert i Medlemskapet til enhver tid og skal ikke stå til
ansvar overfor Kunden for slike endringer; (b) Kunden kan kreves å koble seg til Internett og logge inn
til enhver tid i løpet av Medlemskapsperioden; (c) Programvare kan automatisk koble seg til Internett
for å verifisere Kundens Medlemskap til enhver tid, uten meddelelse; og (d) Kunden skal ikke gjøre det
mulig og tillate at andre bruker Programvaren som Kunden.
2.3 Innholdsfiler. Med mindre annet er uttalt i «Read-Me»-filer, Dokumentasjon, eller andre lisenser
relatert til Innholdsfilene, kan Kunden bruke, vise, modifisere, reprodusere og distribuere alle
Innholdsfiler. Kunden kan imidlertid ikke distribuere Innholdsfilene på frittstående grunnlag
(eksempelvis der Innholdsfilene utgjør hovedverdien av det produktet som distribueres), og Kunden
kan ikke gjøre krav på rettigheter til varemerker i Innholdsfilene eller avledet arbeid av dem. Ingenting
av det som er uttalt her skal påvirke eierskapet av Programvaren som uttalt under punkt 3.
2.4 Prøve av applikasjonskode. Kunden kan endre kildekoden i de delene av slike Programmer som er
uttrykkelig identifisert som prøvekode, prøver av applikasjonskoder, kodestumper, ActionScript-
klassefiler, eller prøver av komponenter (hvert tilfelle en «Prøve av Applikasjonskode») i den vedlagte
Dokumentasjonen, utelukkende med det formålet å designe, utvikle og teste nettsider og programmer
som er utviklet med Adobe-programmer. Dette forutsetter imidlertid at Kunden har tillatelse til å
kopiere og distribuere Prøvene av Applikasjonskode (endret eller uendret), såfremt følgende vilkår er
oppfylt: (a) Kunden distribuerer kun kompilerte objektkodeversjoner av Prøven av Applikasjonskode
sammen med Kundens applikasjon; (b) Kunden inkluderer ikke Prøve av Applikasjonskode i et produkt
eller en applikasjon som er designet for nettsideutvikling; og (c) Kunden bruker ikke Adobes navn, logo
eller andre Adobe-varemerker for å markedsføre Kundens applikasjon. Du samtykker i å erstatte, holde
skadesløs og forsvare Adobe fra og mot ethvert tap, skade, krav eller søksmål, inkludert advokatsalær
som skyldes bruk eller distribusjon av applikasjonen din.
--- Page 311 ---
2.5 Programmeringsspråk. Programvaren kan omfatte deler av ExtendScript SDK og Pixel Bender SDK. I
henhold til begrensningene under punkt 2, gir Adobe deg en ikke-eksklusiv, ikke-overførbar og avgiftsfri
lisens til å bruke elementene i ExtendScript SDK og Pixel Bender SDK utelukkende i den hensikt å
utvikle interne programmer som er utviklet for bruk med Adobe-produkter. Med unntak av det som
uttrykkelig er gjengitt her i punkt 2.5, kan ingen deler av ExtendScript SDK og Pixel Bender SDK endres
eller distribueres. Kunden samtykker i å erstatte, holde skadesløs og forsvare Adobe fra og mot ethvert
tap, skade, krav eller søksmål, inkludert advokatsalær som skyldes slik distribusjon.
2.6 Dokumentasjonskopier. Kunden kan lage kopier av Dokumentasjonen for egen intern bruk i
forbindelse med bruk av Programvaren i henhold til denne avtalen, men ikke flere enn det antallet som
er rimelig og nødvendig.
3. Immaterielle rettigheter.
Programvaren, og enhver autorisert kopi som Kunden lager, er de immaterielle rettighetene til, og eies
av, Adobe Systems Incorporated og dets leverandører. Strukturen, organiseringen og kildekoden til
Programvaren er verdifulle forretningshemmeligheter og konfidensiell informasjon som tilhører Adobe
Systems Incorporated og Adobes leverandører. Programvaren er beskyttet av lov, herunder, men ikke
begrenset til, opphavsrettslovgivningen i USA og andre land, og av internasjonale traktater. Såfremt det
ikke er uttrykkelig uttalt herunder, bevilger ikke denne avtalen noen immaterielle rettigheter til
Programvaren til Kunden. Adobe og dets leverandører forbeholder seg alle rettigheter som ikke er
uttrykkelig gitt i henhold til denne avtalen.
4. Begrensninger og krav.
4.1 Rettighetserklæringer. Alle kopier Kunden lager av Programvaren må inneholde de samme
erklæringene om opphavsrett og eierskap som finnes i den opprinnelige Programvaren.
4.2 Bruksforpliktelser. Kunden samtykker i at den ikke vil bruke Programvaren på annen måte enn det
som er tillatt i denne avtalen, og at du ikke vil bruke Programvaren på en måte som avviker fra dens
design eller Dokumentasjon.
4.3 Ingen endringer. Med unntak av det som er uttrykkelig tillatt under punkt 2 eller 16, kan Kunden
ikke modifisere, overføre, bearbeide eller oversette Programvaren.
4.4 Ingen omvendt konstruksjon («Reverse Engineering»). Kunden skal ikke reverskonstruere,
dekompilere, demontere eller på annen måte forsøke å avdekke kildekoden til Programvaren.
4.5 Ingen oppdeling. Programvaren kan inneholde forskjellige applikasjoner og komponenter, kan
tillate tilgang til forskjellige Adobe Online Services, kan støtte flere plattformer og språk, og kan bli
levert til Kunden på flere medier eller i flere kopier. Ikke desto mindre, er Programvaren utviklet og
levert til Kunden som ett enkelt produkt, til bruk som ett enkelt produkt på Datamaskiner som er tillatt
herunder. Såfremt annet ikke er bevilget i Dokumentasjonen, kreves det ikke av Kunden at den
installerer alle komponentdelene av Programvaren, men Kunden skal ikke dele opp komponentdelene
i Programvaren til bruk på forskjellige Datamaskiner.
4.6 Ingen overføring.
4.6.1 KUNDEN SKAL IKKE LEIE UT, LEASE, SELGE, VIDERELISENSIERE, TILDELE ELLER OVERFØRE DENS
RETTIGHETER TIL PROGRAMVAREN ELLER AUTORISERE HELE ELLER DELER AV PROGRAMVAREN

punkt 4.6.3, kan Kunden permanent overføre alle sine rettigheter til å bruke Programvaren til en annen
person eller juridisk enhet dersom: (a) Kunden også overfører (i) denne avtalen, (ii) serienummer(ene),
Programvaren som ligger på medier fra Adobe eller Adobes autoriserte forhandler, og all annen
programvare eller maskinvare som følger med, er pakket med, eller er forhåndsinstallert med
Programvaren, herunder alle kopier, Oppdateringer og tidligere versjoner (som definert under punkt 5
nedenfor) og (iii) alle kopier av skrifttypeprogramvare til slik person eller enhet; (b) Kunden ikke
beholder noen Oppdateringer, tidligere versjoner eller kopier, heller ikke sikkerhetskopier eller kopier
som er lagret på en Datamaskin; og (c) mottakeren godtar vilkårene og betingelsene i denne avtalen og
alle andre vilkår og betingelser som gjaldt da Kunden kjøpte en gyldig lisens til Programvaren.
Ytterligere informasjon om overføring av volumlisensiert programvare er tilgjengelig på
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_no.
4.6.3 Dersom Programvaren krever periodisk aktivering eller registrering og Adobe innvilger Kundens
ønske om å bli unntatt kravet om en slik periodisk aktivering eller registrering, skal rettigheten til å
permanent overføre, som beskrevet under punkt 4.6.2, opphøre umiddelbart ved innvilgningen av et
slikt ønske, i tillegg til restriksjonene forklart i Aktiveringsbetingelser (som definert under punkt 14.3).

PC-enheter eller med en innebygd versjon eller enhetsversjon av noe som helst slags operativsystem.
For å unngå tvil, og kun som eksempler, kan Kunden ikke bruke Adobe Runtime på en (a) mobil
innretning, set top boxes (STB), håndholdte enheter, telefoner, spillkonsoller, TV-er, DVD-spillere,
mediesentre (unntatt Windows XP Media Center Edition og dets etterfølgere), elektroniske
oppslagstavler eller digital tegnangiver («digital signage»), Internett-hjelpemiddel («Internet
appliances») eller andre innretninger tilknyttet Internett, PDA-er, medisinske innretninger, minibanker,
telematiske («telematic») innretninger, spillmaskiner, hjemmeautomasjonssystemer, kiosker,
fjernstyringsenheter eller andre elektroniske artikler rettet mot forbruker; (b) operatørbaserte mobil-;
kabel-; satellitt- eller tv-systemer; eller (c) andre innretninger for lukkede systemer. Ytterligere
informasjon om lisensiering av Adobe Runtime-moduler er tilgjengelig på
http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_no.
4.9 Territorium. Kunden skal kun bruke Programvaren og Adobes online-tjenester i et Territorium og på
en måte som er i henhold til aktiveringsforskriftene som er beskrevet på
http://www.adobe.com/no/activation_no. Adobe forbeholder retten til å avslutte lisensen som innvilges
i dette dokument eller innstille Medlemskapet eller tilgangen til Adobes online-tjenester dersom Adobe
fastslår at Kunden bruker Programvaren eller Adobes online-tjenester utenfor gyldig Territorium.
5. Oppdateringer.
Dersom Programvaren er en Oppdatering til en tidligere versjon av programvare fra Adobe («Tidligere
Versjon»), er Kundens bruk av denne Oppdateringen betinget på Kundens bibeholdelse av den
Tidligere Versjonen. Hvis Kunden derfor foretar en gyldig overføring av denne Oppdateringen i henhold
til punkt 4.6, må Kunden samtidig overføre den Tidligere Versjonen. Hvis Kunden ønsker å bruke denne
Oppdateringen i tillegg til den Tidligere Versjonen, kan dette kun gjøres på den samme Datamaskinen
som Kunden har installert og bruker den Tidligere Versjonen på. Eventuelle forpliktelser Adobe har til å
gi støtte til Tidligere Versjoner kan opphøre når denne Oppdateringen blir tilgjengelig. Ingen annen
bruk av Oppdateringen er tillatt. Ytterligere Oppdateringer kan lisensieres til Kunden av Adobe med
tilføyde eller endrede vilkår.
6. Begrenset garanti.
Såfremt annet ikke er uttalt i en særskilt avtale mellom Adobe og en innehaver av Programvarelisens,
garanterer Adobe til personen eller enheten som først kjøper lisens til Programvaren for bruk i samsvar
--- Page 313 ---
med vilkårene i denne avtalen, at Programvaren i det vesentlige vil fungere i henhold til den gjeldende
brukermanualen for Programvaren i den korteste perioden av (a) nitti (90) dager eller
(b) Lisensperioden etter at Programvaren er mottatt («Garantiperiode») når den brukes med anbefalt
operativsystem og maskinvarekonfigurasjon. Ikke-vesentlig variasjon i ytelsen i forhold til
brukermanualen gir imidlertid ingen garantirett. Denne begrensede garantien gjelder ikke for følgende,
som gis «SOM DE ER» og uten garanti fra Adobe: (i) oppdateringsfiler; (ii) fontprogramvare;
(iii) Forhåndsversjon, programvare for utprøving, starting, produktprøver, Evalueringsprogramvare, og

tjenester, online-tjenester fra tredjepart; (v) sertifiserte dokumenttjenester (se punkt 16); og
(vi) eventuell programvare som Adobe gjør gratis tilgjengelig via nedlasting på nettet fra et Adobe-
nettsted. Alle garantikrav må gjøres gjeldende, sammen med kjøpsbevis, til Adobes
kundestøtteavdeling, innenfor Garantiperioden. Ytterligere informasjon om garantikrav er tilgjengelig
på http://www.adobe.com/go/support_no. Hvis Programvaren i det vesentlige ikke fungerer i henhold
til brukermanualen, vil Adobe eller Adobes samarbeidspartneres fulle ansvar og Kundens eneste krav
eller avhjelp være begrenset til, etter Adobes valg, enten erstatning av Programvaren eller
tilbakebetaling av lisensavgiften Kunden betalte for Programvaren (hvis aktuelt). DEN BEGRENSEDE
GARANTIEN SOM ER ANGITT I DETTE PUNKTET GIR KUNDEN BESTEMTE JURIDISKE RETTIGHETER.
KUNDEN KAN DESSUTEN HA FLERE RETTIGHETER I HENHOLD TIL LOVER SOM VARIERER FRA
JURISDIKSJON TIL JURISDIKSJON. ADOBE PRØVER IKKE Å BEGRENSE KUNDENS
GARANTIRETTIGHETER UTOVER DET SOM ER LOVBESTEMT. Se punkt 16 for spesielle bestemmelser i
den aktuelle jurisdiksjonen, eller ta kontakt med Adobes kundestøtteavdeling.

JURISDIKSJONER. DU KAN DESSUTEN HA FLERE RETTIGHETER I HENHOLD TIL LOVER SOM VARIERER
FRA JURISDIKSJON TIL JURISDIKSJON. ADOBE PRØVER IKKE Å BEGRENSE KUNDENS
GARANTIRETTIGHETER UTOVER DET SOM ER LOVBESTEMT. Reglene i punktene 7 og 8 skal gjelde
selv om avtalen opphører, uansett årsak, men dette skal ikke innebære eller gi fortsatt rett til å bruke
Programvaren etter at avtalen er opphørt.
8. Ansvarsbegrensning.
MED UNNTAK AV DE EKSKLUSIVE RETTSMIDLER SOM TILBYS OVENFOR AV ADOBE OG EVENTUELL
OPPREISNING SOM IKKE KAN UTELATES ELLER BEGRENSES I HENHOLD TIL LOVEN, VIL IKKE ADOBE,

LOVBESTEMT. SE PUNKT 16 FOR JURISDIKSJONSSPESIFIKKE ERKLÆRINGER.
9. Eksportregler.
Kunden erkjenner at Programvaren er underlagt reguleringer fra den amerikanske
eksportadministrasjonen (U.S. Export Administration) og at Kunden vil opptre i samsvar med disse.
Kunden skal ikke eksportere eller reeksportere Programvaren, direkte eller indirekte, til: (a) land som er
underlagt USAs eksportrestriksjoner (inkludert, men ikke begrenset til, Kuba, Iran, Nord-Korea, Sudan
og Syria), (b) sluttbrukere som Kunden vet eller har grunn til å tro vil nytte Programvaren til design,
utvikling eller produsering av atomvåpen, kjemiske eller biologiske våpen, eller rakettsystem,
romfartøysutskyting og rakettsonder, eller ubemannede luftfartøyssystemer, eller (c) sluttbrukere som
har fått forbud mot å delta i amerikanske eksporttransaksjoner av en føderal organisasjon som er del av
de amerikanske myndigheter. I tillegg er Kunden ansvarlig for å opptre i samsvar med eventuelle lokale
lover i Kundens jurisdiksjon som kan innvirke på Kundens rettigheter til å importere, eksportere eller
bruke Programvaren. Dersom Adobe har kunnskap om at en overtredelse er begått, kan Adobe få
forbud mot å yte vedlikehold og støtte for Programvaren.
10. Gjeldende lov.
Hvis Kunden er en forbruker som bare benytter Programvaren til personlig og ikke-forretningsmessig
bruk, styres denne avtalen av lovene i den jurisdiksjonen der Kunden kjøpte lisensen for å bruke
Programvaren. Hvis Kunden ikke er en slik forbruker, vil denne avtalen være underlagt og bli tolket i
henhold til de vesentlige lovene som gjelder i: (a) staten California, hvis en Programvarelisens er kjøpt
mens Kunden er i USA, Canada eller Mexico; eller (b) Japan, hvis en Programvarelisens er kjøpt mens
Kunden er i Japan; eller (c) Singapore, hvis en Programvarelisens er kjøpt mens Kunden er i ett av
landene i den sørasiatiske samarbeidsorganisasjonen ASEAN, Fastlandskina, Hong Kong SAR og Macau
SAR, Taiwan eller Sør-Korea; eller (d) England, hvis en Programvarelisens er kjøpt mens Kunden er i en
jurisdiksjon som ikke er nevnt over. De respektive domstolene i Santa Clara County i California når
lovene i California gjelder, Tokyo District Court i Japan når lovene i Japan gjelder, og de kompetente
domstolene i London når lovene i England gjelder, skal hver for seg ha ikke-eksklusiv jurisdiksjon over
alle tvister i forbindelse med denne avtalen. Når lovene i Singapore gjelder, skal tvister som oppstår ut
fra eller i forbindelse med denne avtalen, inkludert spørsmål angående dens eksistens, gyldighet eller
oppsigelse, refereres til og endelig løses ved voldgift i Singapore i samsvar med voldgiftsreglene til
Singapore International Arbitration Centre («SIAC») som for tiden er i kraft. Disse reglene skal anses å
være innlemmet ved henvisning i dette punktet. Det skal være én voldgiftsmann, valgt av partene i
fellesskap. Hvis voldgiftsmannen ikke er valgt innen tretti (30) dager etter mottak av det skriftlige kravet
fra en part om å underkaste seg voldgift, skal formannen av SIAC (Chairman of the SIAC) velge. Språket
--- Page 315 ---
som skal brukes under voldgiften skal være engelsk. Uavhengig av bestemmelsene i denne avtalen, kan
Adobe eller Kunden be hvilken som helst rettslig, administrativ eller annen autoritet om å beordre
midlertidig eller bevarende tiltak, inkludert rettslig bistand, naturaloppfyllelse eller annen upartisk
unnsetning, før iverksettelse av rettssak eller voldgift eller under forhandlingene, for å bevare
rettighetene og interessene eller for å opprettholde bestemte vilkår som er hensiktsmessige som
midlertidig rettsmiddel. Denne avtalen vil ikke være underlagt det følgende, hvis anvendelse er
uttrykkelig unntatt: (x) regler forbundet med konflikter med lovvalg i noen jurisdiksjon, (y) FNs
konvensjon om internasjonalt salg av varer og (z) den amerikanske UCITA-loven (Uniform Computer
Information Transactions Act), som vedtatt i enhver jurisdiksjon.
11. Generelle bestemmelser.
Hvis hvilken som helst del av denne avtalen blir kjent ugyldig og ikke kan håndheves, så påvirker ikke
dette gyldigheten av denne avtalen for øvrig, og den skal fortsatt være gyldig og gjennomføres i
samsvar med sine bestemmelser. Denne avtalen kan bare endres skriftlig og ved signering av en
autorisert person i ledende stilling hos Adobe. Den engelske versjonen av denne avtalen skal brukes når
avtalen skal tolkes eller analyseres. Dette er den fullstendige avtalen mellom Adobe og deg i forbindelse
med Programvaren, og den erstatter enhver tidligere utsagn, diskusjon, forpliktelse, kommunikasjon
eller markedsføring knyttet til Programvaren.
12. Meddelelse til amerikanske myndigheter som sluttbrukere.
12.1 Amerikanske myndigheters Lisensiering av Adobe-teknologi. Kunden godtar at når Adobe
Programvare blir lisensiert for tilegnelse av amerikanske myndigheter, eller derved andre leverandører,
vil lisensieringen være i samsvar med retningslinjer fremsatt i 48 C.F.R. punkt 12.212 (for sivile selskap)
og 48 C.F.R. punkt 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-4 (for det amerikanske forsvarsdepartementet). For
amerikanske myndigheter som sluttbrukere sier Adobe seg enig i og innforstått med å følge alle
gjeldende likestillingslover, inkludert, om anvendelig, bestemmelsene i Executive Order 11246, som
endret, del 402 i Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act fra 1974 (38 USC 4212) og del 503
i Rehabilitation Act fra 1973, som endret, og bestemmelsene i 41 CFR del 60-1 til 60-60, 60-250,
og 60-741. «The affirmative action clause» (Bekreftelseshandlingsregelen) og bestemmelsene
inneholdt i foregående setning skal bygges inn ved referanse i denne avtalen.
12.2 Kommersielle elementer. For amerikanske myndigheter som sluttbrukere er Programvaren en
«Handelsvare» («Commercial Item(s)»), som definert i 48 C.F.R. punkt 2.101, og består av
«Kommersiell programvare» («Commercial Computer Software») og «Dokumentasjon til kommersiell
programvare» («Commercial Computer Software Documentation»), slik begrepene er benyttet i 48
C.F.R. punkt 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R. punkt 227.7202, der de får anvendelse. I samsvar med 48 C.F.R.
punkt 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R. punkt 227.7202-1 til 227.7202-4, der de får anvendelse, er Kommersiell
programvare og Dokumentasjon for kommersiell programvare lisensiert til amerikanske myndigheter
som sluttbrukere (a) bare som Handelsvarer, og (b) bare med de rettigheter som gjelder i forhold til
hvilke som helst andre sluttbrukere i overensstemmelse med herværende betingelser og vilkår.
Upubliserte rettigheter er forbeholdt i henhold til amerikansk opphavsrett.
13. Overensstemmelse med lisenser.
Dersom Kunden er en bedrift, et firma eller en organisasjon, samtykker Kunden i at Adobe eller en
autorisert representant for Adobe i tillegg til lisenskontrollen som utføres av programvaren ikke oftere
enn hver tolvte (12.) måned, med syv (7) arbeidsdagers varsel, skal ha rett til å inspisere arkiver,
systemer og fasiliteter for å bekrefte at bruken av all programvare fra Adobe er i samsvar med en gyldig
lisens fra Adobe. Adobe har for eksempel rettigheten til de av Kundens fortegnelser som er nyttige for å
avgjøre om installasjoner av Programvaren har, eller ikke har, blitt serieomkodet, og Kunden har plikt til
å fremlegge slike fortegnelser for Adobe uoppfordret på forespørsel fra Adobe. I tillegg skal Kunden gi
Adobe tilgang til alle arkiver og informasjon som Adobe ber om, for å bekrefte at bruken av alle
--- Page 316 ---
Programvarene fra Adobe er i samsvar med de gyldige lisensene fra Adobe innen tretti (30) dager av
Adobes forespørsel. Ytterligere informasjon om føljetonger er tilgjengelig på
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_no.
14. Internett-tilkobling og personvern.
14.1 Automatisk tilkobling til Internett. Programvaren kan gjøre at Kundens Datamaskin, uten videre
varsel, automatisk kobles til Internett for å kommunisere med en Adobe-nettside eller et Adobe-
domene for formål som kan inkludere å gi Kunden ytterligere informasjon, egenskaper og
funksjonalitet. Med mindre annet er angitt i punkt 14.2 til og med 14.7, gjelder følgende bestemmelser
for all automatisk Internett-tilkobling gjennom Programvaren:
14.1.1 Når Programvaren kobler på Internett og kommuniserer med en Adobe-webside, enten
automatisk eller brukerstyrt, skal Adobes personvernerklæring på nettet gjelde. Merk at Adobes
personvernerklæring tillater sporing av besøk på nettsteder, og den beskriver i detalj sporing og bruk av
informasjonskapsler, websignaler og lignende enheter.
14.1.2 Når en Programvare kobler seg til Adobe over Internett, vil en viss Kundeinformasjon samles og
sendes av Programvaren til Adobe i overenstemmelse med Adobe Online personvern som er
tilgjengelig på http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_no («Personvern»).
14.1.3 Derom Kunden bruker Adobes nettbaserte tjenester (som definert under punkt 16.4 nedenfor)
eller aktiverer eller registrerer Programvaren, kan ytterligere informasjon som Kundens Adobe-ID,
brukernavn, og passord bli sendt til, og lagret av Adobe i overensstemmelse med Personvern og
tilleggsbetingelser relatert til Adobes nettbaserte tjenester (sammen med bruksbetingelsene på
Adobe.com og eventuelle gjeldende betingelser kalt «Tilleggsbetingelser»).
14.1.4 I overensstemmelse med gjeldende lover eller med samtykke fra Kunden, kan Adobe (a) sende
transaksjonelle meldinger til Kunden for å forenkle Adobes nettbaserte tjenester eller aktiveringen eller
registreringen av Programvaren eller Adobes nettbaserte tjenester, eller (b) levere markedsføring i
produktet for å gi informasjon om Programvaren og andre Adobe-produkter og -tjenester, inkludert,
men ikke begrenset til, plattformversjon, programvareversjon, lisensstatus og språk.
14.2 Oppdatering. Programvaren kan gjøre at din Datamaskin, uten ytterligere varsel, automatisk kobles
til Internett (sporadisk eller regelmessig) for å (a) sjekke om det finnes tilgjengelige oppdateringer for
nedlasting til og installasjon på din Datamaskin, og (b) gi Adobe tilbakemelding om resultatene av
installasjonsforsøkene.
14.3 Aktivering. Programvaren kan kreve at Kunden (a) anskaffer et Adobe-ID, (b) aktiverer eller
reaktiverer Programvaren, (c) registrerer Programvaren, eller (d) verifiserer Medlemskapet. Slike krav
kan forårsake at Kundens Datamaskin kobler seg på Internett uten varsel ved installering, oppstart, og
deretter på periodisk basis. Når Internettet er tilkoblet, vil Programvaren samle og sende informasjon til
Adobe som videre forklart på http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_no («Aktiveringsbetingelser»).
Programvare eller Kunde kan også motta informasjon fra Adobe relatert til Kundens lisens, abonnement
eller Medlemskap. Adobe kan også bruke slik informasjon til å påvise eller forhindre urederlig eller
uautorisert bruk som ikke er i overensstemmelse med gyldig lisens, abonnement eller Medlemskap.
Ved unnlatelse av å aktivere eller registrere Programvaren, verifisere abonnementet eller
Medlemskapet, eller påvisning fra Adobe av urederlig eller uautorisert bruk av Programvaren kan
resultere i nedsatt funksjon, at Programvaren blir satt ut av funksjon, eller oppsigelse eller suspendering
av abonnementet eller Medlemskapet.
14.4 Deaktivering. Kunden kan deaktivere og avinstallere Programvaren fra Datamaskinen dens for så å
installere og aktivere Programvaren på en annen Datamaskin i overensstemmelse med denne avtalen
(«Deaktivering») og som videre forklart på http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_no. Deaktivering
krever Internett-tilkobling.
--- Page 317 ---
14.5 Bruk av nettbaserte tjenester. Programvaren kan gjøre at Datamaskinen uten ytterligere varsel
automatisk kobles sporadisk eller regelmessig til Internett for å gi enklere tilgang til innhold og tjenester
som Adobe gjør tilgjengelig for Kunden eller tredjeparter, som nærmere beskrevet i punkt 16.4
(Nettbaserte tjenester). Programvaren kan videre uten ytterligere varsel automatisk kobles sporadisk
eller regelmessig til Internett for å oppdatere nedlastbare materialer fra disse nettbaserte tjenestene, slik
at Kunden gis umiddelbar tilgang til disse tjenestene selv når Kunden er frakoblet.
14.6 Digitale sertifikater. Programvaren bruker digitale sertifikater (som beskrevet under punkt 16.5) for
å hjelpe Kunden med å identifisere nedlastede filer (for eksempel programmer og innhold) og utgiverne
av disse filene. For eksempel bruker Adobe AIR digitale sertifikater til å hjelpe Kunden å identifisere
utgiveren av Adobe AIR-programmer. Adobe Acrobat-familien av produkter bruker også digitale
sertifikater til å signere og validere signaturer i PDF-dokumenter, og til å validere sertifiserte PDF-
dokumenter. Kundens Datamaskinen kan kobles til Internett når et digitalt sertifikat skal valideres.
14.7 Innstillingsbehandling. Programvaren kan inneholde Flash Player. Flash Player kan gjøre at visse
brukerinnstillinger blir lagret på datamaskinen din som et lokalt, delt objekt. De er forbundet med
tilstedeværelsen av Flash Player på Datamaskinen, og lar Kunden skreddersy kjøremønsteret.
Innstillingsbehandling for Flash Player gjør at du kan endre slike innstillinger, inkludert muligheten til å
forhindre at tredjeparter lagrer lokalt delte objekter eller gir tredjepartsinnhold tilgangsrett til din
datamaskins mikrofon og kamera. Du kan finne mer informasjon om hvordan du konfigurerer
innstillinger i din versjon av Flash Player, inkludert hvordan du deaktiverer lokalt delte objekter i
Innstillingsbehandling for Flash Player, på http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_no. Ytterligere
informasjon om lokalt delte objekter er tilgjengelig på
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_no.
15. Kommunikasjon mellom datamaskiner.
Programvaren kan benytte tilkoblingen til et lokalt nettverk for uten ytterligere varsel å koble seg
automatisk til annen Adobe-programvare, og kan i den anledning angi i det lokale nettverket at den er
tilgjengelig for kommunikasjon med annen Adobe-programvare. Disse tilkoblingene kan sende IP-
adressen til Kundens tilkobling til det lokale nettverket.
16. Spesifikke bestemmelser og unntak.
Denne delen av avtalen fastsetter spesifikke bestemmelser knyttet til visse produkter og komponenter i
Programvaren, i tillegg til å fastsette begrensede unntak fra de vilkår og betingelser som er nevnt
ovenfor. Dersom noen av bestemmelsene i denne delen av avtalen skulle være i konflikt med andre
vilkår eller betingelser i denne avtalen, skal denne delen av avtalen være gjeldende og erstatte disse
vilkårene og betingelsene.
16.1 Ingen skade eller forringelse; EU-bestemmelser; merknad om australske bestemmelser.
16.1.1 Denne avtalen skal ikke få virkning til skade eller forringelse for en part i forhold til lovbestemte
rettigheter, herunder dem som opptrer som forbrukere. For forbrukere i New Zealand som anskaffer
Programvaren til personlig bruk eller til bruk i hjemmet (ikke til bedriftsbruk), er for eksempel denne
avtalen underlagt New Zealands Consumer Guarantees Act.
16.1.2 Hvis Kunden kjøpte Programvaren i Den europeiske union (EU), vanligvis bor i EU og er en
forbruker (dvs. at Kunden anvender Programvaren for personlige, ikke-forretningsmessige formål) så
gjelder ikke punkt 6 for Kundens kjøp og Kundens anvendelse av Programvaren. Isteden garanterer
Adobe i en periode på 2 år fra kjøpsdatoen at Programvaren leverer funksjonaliteten som beskrevet i
Dokumentasjonen (de «avtalte funksjonalitetene») når Programvaren brukes på den anbefalte
maskinvarekonfigurasjonen. Uvesentlig avvik fra de avtalte funksjonalitetene gir ingen
garantirettigheter. DENNE GARANTIEN GJELDER IKKE PROGRAMVARE SOM KUNDEN BRUKER SOM
FORHÅNDSVERSJON, PROGRAMVARE FOR UTPRØVING, STARTER, PRODUKTPRØVER ELLER
--- Page 318 ---
FONTPROGRAMVARE, ELLER HVIS PROGRAMVAREN IKKE VIRKER SOM DEN SKAL FORDI KUNDEN
HAR ENDRET DEN. Alle garantikrav må gjøres gjeldende, sammen med kjøpsbevis, til Adobes
kundestøtteavdeling, innenfor denne 2-årsperioden. Adobe vil så bekrefte om Programvaren er defekt
eller om den ikke er installert riktig (i så fall vil Adobe hjelpe Kunden med det). Hvis Programvaren er
defekt kan Kunden enten be om refusjon eller en reparert eller ny versjon av Programvaren. Kjøpsbevis
skal vedlegges slike krav. Hvis Kundens garantidetaljer er dokumentert, vil Adobe etterkomme Kundens
anmodning om reparert eller ny Programvare, med mindre Adobe betrakter det som urimelig, i hvilket
fall vil Kunden få refusjon. Hvis Kunden ønsker hjelp med garantispørsmål, kan Kunden kontakte
Adobes kundestøtteavdeling.
Vennligst bemerk at bestemmelsene i punkt 8 (Ansvarsbegrensning) fortsatt gjelder for eventuelle
skadeerstatningskrav Kunden stiller i forbindelse med bruk av Programvaren. Adobe skal likevel ikke
holdes ansvarlig for direkte tap som er rimelig forutsigbare i tilfelle mislighold av avtalen fra Adobes
side. Kunden rådes til å ta alle rimelige forholdsregler for å unngå og redusere skader, spesielt ved å
lage sikkerhetskopier av Programvaren og data på datamaskinen dens.
Denne avtalen, og spesielt punkt 16.1.2, skal beskrive Kundens rettigheter (herunder dine lovbestemte
rettigheter) dersom det skulle oppstå problemer med bruken av Programvaren. Hvis Kundens
lovbestemte rettigheter omfatter mer enn denne beskrivelsen, skal disse gjelde.
16.1.3 Ingenting i denne avtalen (herunder punkt 4.4) skal begrense noen ikke-fraskrivbar rett til å
dekompilere Programvaren Kunden anvender under gjeldende lov. Hvis Kunden for eksempel befinner
seg innen EU, kan Kunden på visse betingelser, som er angitt i gjeldende lover, ha rett til å dekompilere
Programvaren hvis dette er nødvendig for å gjøre den kompatibel med annen programvare, og Kunden
på forhånd skriftlig har anmodet Adobe om nødvendig informasjon for å oppnå slik kompatibilitet, og
Adobe ikke har gjort informasjonen tilgjengelig. Videre kan slik dekompilering bare utføres av Kunden
eller en annen med tillatelse til å bruke en kopi av Programvaren på Kundens vegne. Adobe har rett til å
sette rimelige betingelser før informasjonen gis. All informasjon Adobe gir eller Kunden skaffer, som
tillatt i henhold til dette, kan bare brukes av Kunden for det formålet som er beskrevet i denne avtalen,
og kan ikke gis videre til en tredjepart eller brukes til å lage programvare som er vesentlig lik uttrykket
av Programvaren, eller brukt til eventuelle andre formål som krenker opphavsretten til Adobe eller
Adobes lisensgivere.
16.1.4 Dersom Kunden anskaffer Programvaren i Australia, skal følgende forskrifter gjelde, til tross for
eventuelle motsigelser i denne Avtalen:
MERKNAD TIL FORBRUKERE I AUSTRALIA:
Våre varer kommer med garantier som ikke kan unntas under Forbrukerloven i Australia. Du har rett på
erstatning eller refusjon for store feil og kompensasjon for eventuelle andre påregnelige tap eller skader
innenfor rimelighetens grenser. Du har også rett på å få varene reparert eller erstattet dersom varene
ikke er av akseptabel kvalitet og feilen ikke kan betegnes som en stor feil. Programvareproduktene våre
kommer i tillegg med en 90 dagers begrenset garanti gitt av Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited,
med kontor ved 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irland, som beskrevet i Avtalen.
Dersom produktene dine ikke yter de generelle funksjonene som er beskrevet i Brukerdokumentasjon i
løpet av 90-dagersperioden etter levering, kan du ringe Adobes kundestøtteavdeling på 1800 614 863
med detaljer om produktet ditt, serienummer og kjøpsbevis. Du kan bli bedt om å levere tilbake
produktet ditt til en adresse du vil få oppgitt, med utgiftene for tilbakeleveringen dekket av deg.
Fordelene under denne garantien er i tillegg til andre rettigheter og godtgjørelser du kan ha ifølge
loven.
16.2 Tilleggsvilkår for forhåndsversjonsprogramvare. Hvis Programvaren er en forhåndsversjon eller
betaprogramvare («Forhåndsversjonsprogramvare»), gjelder dette punktet.
Forhåndsversjonsprogramvaren er en forhåndsversjon, representerer ikke det endelige produktet fra
Adobe og kan inneholde programfeil eller andre feil og problemer som kan føre til systemfeil, andre feil
eller tap av data. Det er mulig at Adobe aldri kommer til å sende Forhåndsversjonsprogramvaren ut på
markedet kommersielt. Hvis Kunden har mottatt Forhåndsversjonsprogramvare i henhold til en separat,
--- Page 319 ---
skriftlig avtale, for eksempel Adobe Systems Incorporateds «License Agreement for Pre-Release
Software», er Kundens bruk av Programvaren også underlagt denne avtalen. Kunden skal returnere
eller tilintetgjøre alle kopier av Forhåndsversjonen på anmodning fra Adobe eller etter at Adobe
kommersielt har sendt slik Programvare ut på markedet, uavhengig av hvilken som skjer først. KUNDEN
BRUKER FORHÅNDSVERSJONSPROGRAMVARE PÅ EGEN RISIKO. SE PUNKT 6 OG 8 FOR
GARANTIFRASKRIVELSER OG ANSVARSBEGRENSNINGER SOM GJELDER FOR
FORHÅNDSVERSJONSPROGRAMVARE.
16.3 Utdanningsprogramvare. Hvis Programvaren er Utdanningsprogramvare (Programvare som kun er
produsert og distribuert for bruk av utdanningssluttbrukere), er Kunden ikke berettiget til å bruke
Programvaren med mindre Kunden er kvalifisert som utdanningssluttbruker i sin jurisdiksjon. Vennligst
besøk http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_no for å lære om kvalifikasjon. Gå til
http://www.adobe.com/go/store_no for å finne nærmeste autoriserte akademiske Adobe-forhandler.
16.4 Nettbaserte tjenester.
16.4.1 Levert av Adobe. Programvaren forenkler tilgang til innhold og diverse tjenester på nettsteder
som Adobe eller Adobes samarbeidspartnere driver («Adobes nettbaserte tjenester»). Eksempler på
Adobes nettbaserte tjenester kan omfatte, men er ikke begrenset til: Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS
Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help, og produktenes
Welcome Screens. I noen tilfeller kan én av Adobes nettbaserte tjenester fremkomme som en egenskap
eller utvidelse i Programvaren, selv om de er lagret på et nettsted. Tilgang til Adobes nettbaserte
tjenester kan kreve at Kunden aktiverer Programvaren, anskaffer en Adobe-ID, godtar
Tilleggsbetingelsene, eller kreve et separat honorar for å få tilgang til Adobes nettbaserte tjenester.
Adobes nettbaserte tjenester er ikke tilgjengelige på alle språk eller for innbyggere i alle land, og Adobe
kan når som helst og av hvilken som helst grunn endre eller stoppe tilgjengeligheten til en nettbasert

ważności licencji, Oprogramowanie może bez dodatkowego powiadomienia dezaktywować się do
czasu otrzymania przez Adobe płatności lub zweryfikowania ważności licencji.
2.1.3 Korzystanie z Oprogramowania na Komputerze przenośnym lub domowym. Z zastrzeżeniem
ważnych ograniczeń określonych w Artykule 2.1.4, główny użytkownik Komputera z
Oprogramowaniem zainstalowanym zgodnie z postanowieniami Artykułu 2.1 („Główny
Użytkownik”) może zainstalować dodatkowy egzemplarz Oprogramowania do swojego wyłącznego
użytku na Komputerze przenośnym lub na Komputerze w swoim domu, pod warunkiem że
Oprogramowanie zainstalowane na Komputerze przenośnym lub domowym nie będzie
wykorzystywane w tym same czasie, co Oprogramowanie zainstalowane na Komputerze głównym.
2.1.4 Ograniczenia ubocznego korzystania z Oprogramowania przez licencjobiorców grupowych. Jeżeli
Oprogramowanie zostało uzyskane w ramach programu lub umowy licencji grupowej Adobe (np.
Adobe Volume Licensing) przez dowolnego licencjobiorcę innego niż edukacyjny licencjobiorca
grupowy, druga kopia Oprogramowania sporządzona na podstawie Artykułu 2.1.3 może być
wykorzystywana jedynie na rzecz i w związku z działalnością takiego licencjobiorcy grupowego.
2.1.5 Platforma z możliwością wyboru systemu operacyjnego przy uruchamianiu. Licencja zezwala na
używanie Oprogramowania w konkretnym systemie operacyjnym. Klient jest zobowiązany do
zakupienia odrębnej licencji na używanie Oprogramowania w każdym systemie operacyjnym, w którym
je uruchamia. Na przykład, jeśli Klient zamierza zainstalować Oprogramowanie zarówno w systemie
operacyjnym Mac, jak i Windows, na urządzeniu, na którym można uruchamiać oba te systemy (tj.
platformie z możliwością wyboru systemu operacyjnego przy uruchamianiu), powinien nabyć dwie
odrębne licencje na Oprogramowanie. Ta zasada obowiązuje nawet wtedy, gdy Klient otrzymał na
jednym nośniku dwie wersje Oprogramowania, przeznaczone dla różnych systemów operacyjnych.
2.1.6 Rozpowszechnianie z serwera. W zakresie, w jakim dopuszcza to Dokumentacja, Klient ma prawo
kopiować obraz Oprogramowania na serwer(y) plików w Sieci Wewnętrznej Klienta („Serwer”) w celu
--- Page 327 ---
umożliwienia pobrania i instalowania Oprogramowania na Komputerach w tej samej Sieci Wewnętrznej
i użytkowania w sposób dozwolony zgodnie z Artykułem 2.
2.1.7 Zastosowanie serwera.
2.1.7.1 Zgodnie z postanowieniami odrębnego dokumentu zakupu lub Dokumentacji i z
uwzględnieniem ograniczeń licencji określonych w niniejszej Umowie, Klient może zainstalować
Oprogramowanie na Serwerze wyłącznie w celu umożliwienia dostępu do Oprogramowania osobom
korzystającym z Komputerów w tej samej Sieci Wewnętrznej („Użytkownikom Sieciowym”). Użytkownik
Sieciowy, który ma dostęp do takiego Oprogramowania na Serwerze, nazywany jest „Użytkownikiem
Oprogramowania Serwerowego”. Łączna liczba Użytkowników Oprogramowania Serwerowego (a nie
liczba jednocześnie pracujących użytkowników) nie może przekroczyć Dozwolonej Liczby. Na przykład,
jeśli Klient zakupił 10 licencji na Oprogramowanie (Dozwolona Liczba wynosi 10) i zainstalował
Oprogramowanie na Serwerze, to Klient może zezwolić maksymalnie 10 Użytkownikom
Oprogramowania Serwerowego na dostęp do Oprogramowania (nawet jeśli u Klienta pracuje więcej
niż 10 Użytkowników Sieciowych lub mniej niż 10 użytkowników jednocześnie używa
Oprogramowania).
2.1.7.2 W szczególności powyższe postanowienie nie zezwala Klientowi na instalowanie
Oprogramowania ani dostęp do Oprogramowania (bezpośredni lub za pośrednictwem poleceń, danych
lub instrukcji): (a) na Komputerze niebędącym częścią Sieci Wewnętrznej Klienta, (b) zabrania się
również stosowania Oprogramowania do obsługi grup roboczych w sieci WWW i świadczenia
ogólnodostępnych usług z serwerów WWW, (c) przez osoby fizyczne lub prawne nieposiadające ważnej
licencji udzielonej przez Adobe na używanie, pobieranie, kopiowanie lub inne wykorzystanie
Oprogramowania, (d) jako składnika systemu, organizacji pracy lub usług, dostępnych dla więcej niż
Dozwolonej Liczby użytkowników, lub (e) do przeprowadzania operacji, które nie są inicjowane przez
indywidualnego użytkownika (np. w celu przetwarzania przy użyciu zautomatyzowanego serwera).
2.2 Członkostwo. Niniejszy Artykuł 2.2 ma zastosowanie do Klientów, którzy zakupili licencję lub usługę
opartą na członkostwie („Członkostwo”), np. członkostwo w chmurze Creative Cloud.
2.2.1 Usługi Elektroniczne Adobe związane z Członkostwem. Pod warunkiem, że Klient nieprzerwanie
przestrzegał będzie postanowień niniejszej Umowy i wnosił należne opłaty licencyjne, o ile takowe
występują, Adobe udziela Klientowi niewyłącznego, obowiązującego na całym Terytorium i
ograniczonego prawa dostępu do Oprogramowania i powiązanej Usługi Elektronicznej Adobe i do
korzystania nich (zgodnie z Artykułem 16.4.1) w ramach Członkostwa, na warunkach niniejszej Umowy i
Dodatkowych Warunkach Używania (definicja tego terminu znajduje się w Artykule 14.1.3).
2.2.2 Licencja na Oprogramowanie związana z Członkostwem. Pod warunkiem, że Klient nieprzerwanie
przestrzegał będzie postanowień niniejszej Umowy i wnosił należne opłaty licencyjne, o ile takowe
występują, Adobe udziela Klientowi niewyłącznej i ograniczonej licencji na instalowanie i używanie
Oprogramowania: (a) na Terytorium, (b) w okresie, w którym Członkostwo jest aktualne i aktywne
(„Okres Członkostwa”) i (c) w sposób zgodny z warunkami określonymi w niniejszej Umowie i
stosownej Dokumentacji. Po upływie lub wcześniejszym zakończeniu Okresu Członkostwa
(x) Oprogramowanie lub niektóre jego części mogą przestać działać bez uprzedzenia i (y) Klient nie ma
prawa do używania Oprogramowania, o ile nie odnowi członkostwa. Wszelkie warunki niniejszej
Umowy odnoszące się do konkretnego Oprogramowania pozostają w mocy w odniesieniu do Klienta i
korzystania przez niego z Oprogramowania.
2.2.3 Zastrzeżenia. Klient zgadza się na następujące dodatkowe warunki i ograniczenia związane z
Członkostwem: (a) Klient wyraża zgodę na dokonanie przez Adobe zmiany typu Oprogramowania (np.
konkretnych składników, wersji, platform, języków) zawartego w Wydaniu Subskrypcyjnym; Adobe
może dokonać takiej zmiany w dowolnym momencie i nie ponosi w związku taką zmianą
odpowiedzialności względem Klienta; (b) w dowolnych terminach w Okresie Członkostwa może być
konieczne nawiązywanie przez Klienta połączenia z Internetem i logowanie się; (c) Oprogramowanie
może w dowolnej chwili automatycznie, bez powiadomienia łączyć się z Internetem w celu
--- Page 328 ---
zweryfikowania ważności Członkostwa Klienta; i (d) Klient nie ma prawa zezwalać innym osobom na
używanie Oprogramowania zamiast Klienta.
2.3 Pliki Treści. O ile nie zaznaczono inaczej w plikach typu „Czytaj mnie”, Dokumentacji lub innych
licencjach skojarzonych z Plikami Treści, Klient jest uprawniony do używania, wyświetlania,
modyfikowania, powielania i rozpowszechniania Plików Treści. Zabrania się jednak dystrybucji Plików
Treści jako samodzielnych produktów (np. w sytuacji, gdy Pliki Treści miałyby stanowić główną wartość
przedmiotu dystrybucji), zaś Klient nie może rościć sobie praw do znaków towarowych w Plikach Treści
ani dziełach pochodnych opracowanych na ich podstawie. Żadne z postanowień niniejszego artykułu
nie wpływają na prawa własności do Oprogramowania określone w Artykule 3.
2.4 Przykładowy Kod Aplikacji. Klientowi wolno modyfikować formę kodu źródłowego tych części
Oprogramowania, które są w dołączonej do nich Dokumentacji wyraźnie określone jako kod
przykładowy, przykładowy kod aplikacji, wycinki kodu, pliki klas ActionScript lub komponenty
przykładowe (każdy z nich zwany „Przykładowym Kodem Aplikacji”) wyłącznie w celu projektowania,
budowania i testowania witryn internetowych i aplikacji opracowanych przy użyciu programów Adobe;
z zastrzeżeniem, że Klientowi wolno kopiować i dystrybuować Przykładowy Kod Aplikacji
(zmodyfikowany lub nie) jedynie wówczas, gdy zostaną spełnione wszystkie następujące warunki:
(a) Klient będzie dystrybuować wraz ze swoją aplikacją wyłącznie skompilowaną obiektową wersję
Przykładowego Kodu Aplikacji; (b) Klient nie umieści Przykładowego Kodu Aplikacji w żadnym
produkcie ani aplikacji przeznaczonych do budowania witryn internetowych; oraz (c) Klient nie
wykorzysta nazwy, logo i ikon Adobe ani jakichkolwiek innych znaków towarowych Adobe w celu
sprzedaży i promowania swojej aplikacji. Klient zobowiązuje się zabezpieczyć, bronić, chronić i zwolnić
Adobe od odpowiedzialności odszkodowawczej z tytułu jakichkolwiek strat, szkód, roszczeń i pozwów,
w tym również kosztów obsługi prawnej, które powstaną w wyniku korzystania lub dystrybucji aplikacji
Klienta.
2.5 Języki programowania. Oprogramowanie może zawierać części pakietów ExtendScript SDK i Pixel
Bender SDK. Z uwzględnieniem ograniczeń zawartych w niniejszym Artykule 2 Adobe udziela Klientowi
niewyłącznej, niepodlegającej przeniesieniu, niewymagającej opłacania tantiem licencji na użytkowanie
elementów pakietów ExtendScript SDK i Pixel Bender SDK wyłącznie w celu wewnętrznego
opracowywania programów aplikacyjnych przeznaczonych do współpracy z produktami Adobe. Z
wyjątkiem przypadków wyraźnie określonych w niniejszym Artykule 2.5 niedozwolone jest
modyfikowanie ani rozpowszechnianie jakichkolwiek części pakietów ExtendScript SDK lub Pixel
Bender SDK. Klient zobowiązuje się zabezpieczyć, bronić, chronić i zwolnić Adobe od odpowiedzialności
odszkodowawczej z tytułu jakichkolwiek strat, szkód, roszczeń lub pozwów, w tym również kosztów
obsługi prawnej, które powstaną w wyniku takiej dystrybucji.
2.6 Kopie Dokumentacji. Klient ma prawo sporządzać kopie Dokumentacji w uzasadnionej liczbie na
swój własny użytek wewnętrzny związany z wykorzystaniem Oprogramowania w sposób zgodny z
niniejszą umową.
3. Prawa własności intelektualnej.
Oprogramowanie oraz wszelkie wykonane przez Klienta kopie Oprogramowania stanowią własność
intelektualną Adobe Systems Incorporated i jej dostawców. Struktura, organizacja oraz kod źródłowy
Oprogramowania stanowią wartościową tajemnicę handlową i informacje poufne Adobe Systems
Incorporated oraz jej dostawców. Oprogramowanie jest chronione prawem, w tym m.in. prawem
autorskim obowiązującym w Stanach Zjednoczonych i w innych krajach oraz postanowieniami innych
międzynarodowych umów. Niniejsza Umowa nie przenosi na Klienta żadnych praw, w szczególności
praw własności intelektualnej, innych niż wyraźnie w niej wskazane. Wszelkie prawa nieudzielone
wyraźnie pozostają zastrzeżone dla Adobe i dostawców Adobe.
--- Page 329 ---
4. Ograniczenia i wymagania.
4.1 Informacja o prawach autorskich. Każda sporządzona przez Klienta zgodnie z umową kopia
Oprogramowania i/lub Dokumentacji musi zawierać te same informacje o prawach autorskich i inne
zastrzeżenia, co umieszczone na lub w Oprogramowaniu.
4.2 Zobowiązania dotyczące używania. Klient zobowiązuje się nie używać Oprogramowania w sposób
inny niż dozwolony na mocy niniejszej umowy, a także w sposób niezgodny z jego przeznaczeniem lub
Dokumentacją.
4.3 Zakaz modyfikowania. Z wyjątkiem przypadków wyraźnie określonych w Artykułach 2 i 16, Klient
nie może wprowadzać modyfikacji, przenosić (ang. port), dokonywać adaptacji ani wykonywać
tłumaczeń Oprogramowania.
4.4 Zakaz odtwarzania kodu źródłowego. Z wyjątkiem sytuacji, w których jest to wyraźnie dozwolone na
mocy Artykułu 16.1, Klient nie będzie korzystał z technik odtwarzania kodu źródłowego, dekompilował,
dezasemblował ani w inny sposób próbował odtworzyć kodu źródłowego Oprogramowania.
4.5 Zakaz osobnego użytkowania części składowych. W skład Oprogramowania mogą wchodzić różne
aplikacje i komponenty. Oprogramowanie może umożliwiać dostęp do różnych Usług Elektronicznych
Adobe, obsługiwać różne platformy i języki i może być udostępniane Klientowi na wielu nośnikach i w
wielu egzemplarzach. Niemniej, Oprogramowanie zostało opracowane i udostępnione Klientowi jako
jeden produkt przeznaczony do całościowego zastosowania na Komputerach, zgodnie z
postanowieniami niniejszej umowy. O ile w Dokumentacji nie zaznaczono inaczej, Klient nie jest

--- Page 330 ---
4.6.3 Jeśli Oprogramowanie wymaga okresowej aktywacji lub rejestracji, a spółka Adobe na wniosek
Klienta zwolniła go z obowiązku dokonywania takiej okresowej aktywacji lub rejestracji, z
uwzględnieniem ograniczeń określonych w Warunkach Aktywacji (według definicji z Artykułu 14.3),
prawo do trwałego zbycia określone w Artykule 4.6.2 ustaje z chwilą udzielenia takiego zwolnienia.
4.7 Zakaz wykorzystywania w charakterze usługi. Klient nie może korzystać z Oprogramowania ani
oferować go na zasadzie sprzedaży usługi. Artykuł 16.6.3 zawiera wyjątek odnoszący się wyłącznie do

na Terytorium i w sposób zgodny z zasadami aktywacji opisanymi na stronie
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_pl. Adobe może unieważnić licencję udzieloną na mocy niniejszej
umowy lub zawiesić Członkostwo lub dostęp do Usług Elektronicznych Adobe, jeśli Adobe stwierdzi, że
Klient używa Oprogramowania lub Usług Elektronicznych Adobe poza Terytorium.
5. Aktualizacje.
Jeśli Oprogramowanie jest Aktualizacją wcześniejszej wersji oprogramowania Adobe („Wcześniejsza
Wersja”), Klient może korzystać z takiej Aktualizacji pod warunkiem zachowania Wcześniejszej Wersji.
Dlatego, jeśli ta Aktualizacja zostanie prawidłowo zbyta na warunkach określonych w Artykule 4.6,
razem z nią musi zostać zbyta także Wcześniejsza Wersja. Korzystanie z tej Aktualizacji równolegle z
Wersją Wcześniejszą jest dozwolone wyłącznie na tym samym Komputerze, na którym jest
zainstalowana i wykorzystywana Wcześniejsza Wersja. Wszelkie zobowiązania Adobe do zapewnienia
wsparcia dotyczącego Wcześniejszych Wersji w Okresie Obowiązywania Licencji mogą wygasać z chwilą
udostępnienia tej Aktualizacji. Nie jest dozwolone żadne inne wykorzystanie Aktualizacji. Licencje na
dodatkowe Aktualizacje mogą być udzielane Klientowi przez Adobe na innych lub dodatkowych
warunkach.
6. Ograniczona gwarancja.
Z zastrzeżeniem postanowień zawartych w odrębnej umowie między Adobe a licencjobiorcą
Oprogramowania, spółka Adobe zapewnia osobę fizyczną lub prawną, która jako pierwsza nabędzie
licencję na Oprogramowanie z przeznaczeniem do używania zgodnie z warunkami niniejszej umowy, że
Oprogramowanie będzie funkcjonować co do zasady zgodnie z odpowiednim podręcznikiem
użytkownika Oprogramowania przez krótszy z następujących okresów: (a) okres dziewięćdziesięciu (90)
dni albo (b) Okres Obowiązywania Licencji liczony od otrzymania Oprogramowania („Okres
Gwarancji”); pod warunkiem że Oprogramowanie będzie używane na Komputerze Kompatybilnym.
Nieznaczne odchylenia w funkcjonowaniu Oprogramowania od opisu w podręczniku użytkownika nie
są podstawą do roszczeń gwarancyjnych. Niniejsza ograniczona gwarancja nie ma zastosowania do
--- Page 331 ---
następujących komponentów, które są udostępniane w stanie, w jakim się znajdują, bez jakiejkolwiek
gwarancji ze strony Adobe: (i) poprawki; (ii) oprogramowanie czcionki; (iii) Wersje Zapoznawcze
Oprogramowania, wersje próbne, wersje startowe, wersje ewaluacyjne, próbki produktów,
Oprogramowanie Próbne i egzemplarze Oprogramowania nieprzeznaczone do odsprzedaży;
(iv) witryny internetowe, Usługi Elektroniczne Adobe, Usługi Elektroniczne Podmiotów Trzecich;
(v) usługi Certified Document Services (patrz Artykuł 16); oraz (vi) wszelkie oprogramowanie
udostępniane przez Adobe bezpłatnie do pobrania z witryny internetowej Adobe. Wszystkie roszczenia
gwarancyjne wraz z dowodem zakupu należy zgłaszać do Działu Obsługi Klienta Adobe w Okresie
Gwarancji. Dodatkowe informacje na temat roszczeń gwarancyjnych są dostępne pod adresem
http://www.adobe.com/go/support_pl. Całkowita odpowiedzialność spółki Adobe i jej podmiotów
stowarzyszonych w związku z takimi roszczeniami gwarancyjnymi oraz uprawnienia Klienta z tytułu
gwarancji ograniczone są do zapewnienia wsparcia użytkownikowi Oprogramowania na podstawie
roszczenia, wymiany Oprogramowania lub — jeśli w opinii Adobe udzielenie wsparcia ani wymiana
Oprogramowania nie są praktycznie uzasadnione — do zwrotu Klientowi ewentualnej opłaty
licencyjnej, jaką zapłacił za Oprogramowanie, przy czym wybór jednego z powyższych środków
zaradczych należy do Adobe. OGRANICZONA GWARANCJA, O KTÓREJ MOWA W NINIEJSZYM
ARTYKULE, PRZYZNAJE KLIENTOWI KONKRETNE PRAWA. KLIENTOWI MOGĄ PRZYSŁUGIWAĆ
DODATKOWE PRAWA USTAWOWE, RÓŻNE W ZALEŻNOŚCI OD JURYSDYKCJI. ADOBE NIE MA NA
CELU OGRANICZENIA UPRAWNIEŃ GWARANCYJNYCH KLIENTA W ZAKRESIE NIEDOZWOLONYM
PRZEZ PRAWO. Artykuł 16 zawiera postanowienia właściwe dla konkretnych jurysdykcji. Dalszych

odpowiedzialności Adobe wobec Klienta w przypadku śmierci lub uszkodzenia ciała spowodowanego
zaniedbaniem Adobe lub z tytułu świadomego wprowadzenia w błąd (oszustwa). Adobe występuje w
imieniu swoich podmiotów stowarzyszonych, dostawców i Organów Certyfikacyjnych w celu zrzeczenia
się, wyłączenia lub ograniczenia zakresu zobowiązań, gwarancji lub odpowiedzialności, ale tylko w tym
zakresie i tylko w tym celu.

KONKRETNYCH JURYSDYKCJI ZAMIESZCZONO W ARTYKULE 16.
9. Zasady dotyczące eksportu.
Klient przyjmuje do wiadomości, że Oprogramowanie podlega przepisom administracyjnym USA
dotyczącym eksportu (ang. Export Administration Regulations, „Przepisy EAR”), i zobowiązuje się do
przestrzegania Przepisów EAR. Niedozwolone jest eksportowanie lub reeksportowanie
Oprogramowania bezpośrednio lub pośrednio do: (a) krajów objętych ograniczeniami eksportu z USA
(w szczególności są to Kuba, Iran, Korea Północna, Sudan i Syria, jednak ta lista może być
niekompletna); (b) użytkowników końcowych, o których Klient wie lub co do których podejrzewa, że
będą używać Oprogramowania lub jego części do projektowania, opracowywania lub wytwarzania
broni jądrowej, chemicznej lub biologicznej, systemów rakietowych, pojazdów kosmicznych i rakiet
sondażowych bądź systemów bezzałogowych statków powietrznych; ani (c) użytkowników końcowych,
którym agencje federalne rządu USA zakazały udziału w transakcjach eksportu z USA. Ponadto Klient
ma obowiązek przestrzegać wszelkich lokalnych przepisów zgodnie z ustawodawstwem, któremu
podlega, a które mogą wpływać na jego prawo do importowania, eksportowania lub używania
Oprogramowania. W razie uzyskania przez Adobe informacji o naruszeniu takich przepisów,
zapewnienie przez Adobe serwisu i wsparcia dotyczącego Oprogramowania może nie być możliwe.
10. Prawo właściwe.

zostanie wybrany w ciągu trzydziestu dni (30) od złożenia przez jedną ze stron pisemnego żądania
przekazania sprawy do arbitrażu, decyzję podejmie Przewodniczący SIAC. Językiem arbitrażu będzie
język angielski. Niezależnie od jakichkolwiek postanowień niniejszej umowy Adobe lub Klient może
zwrócić się do organów sądowych, administracyjnych lub innych o zastosowanie środków
tymczasowych lub zabezpieczających, w tym o nakazanie określonego zachowania, zadośćuczynienia
umownego lub innego godziwego zadośćuczynienia przed rozpoczęciem postępowania prawnego lub
arbitrażowego bądź w trakcie takiego postępowania w celu ochrony praw i interesów własnych oraz
wyegzekwowanie określonych warunków istotnych dla wdrożenia tymczasowych środków zaradczych.
Niniejsza umowa nie podlega następującym przepisom, których zastosowanie ulega niniejszym
wyraźnemu wyłączeniu: (x) przepisom prawa kolizyjnego obowiązującym w jakiejkolwiek jurysdykcji,

jakiej są egzekwowane w jakiejkolwiek jurysdykcji.
11. Postanowienia ogólne.
Jeżeli jakakolwiek część niniejszej umowy będzie nieważna lub niewykonalna, pozostanie to bez
wpływu na pozostałą część niniejszej umowy, która będzie nadal ważna i wykonalna zgodnie z jej
warunkami. Wszelkie zmiany do niniejszej umowy wymagają formy pisemnej i podpisu upoważnionego
pracownika Adobe. Do interpretacji niniejszej umowy będzie służyła jej wersja angielska. Niniejsza
umowa stanowi całość porozumienia pomiędzy Adobe a Klientem w odniesieniu do oprogramowania i
zastępuje wszelkie wcześniejsze oświadczenia, rozmowy, zobowiązania i informacje oraz materiały
reklamowe dotyczące oprogramowania.
12. Informacja dla użytkowników końcowych podlegających rządowi Stanów Zjednoczonych (U.S.
Government End Users).
12.1 Licencjonowanie Technologii Adobe przez amerykańską administrację rządową. Klient deklaruje,
że licencjonowanie Oprogramowania Adobe na potrzeby administracji rządowej USA lub jej
wykonawców, będzie odbywało się zgodnie z zasadami określonymi w artykule 12.212 (dla
departamentów cywilnych) lub artykułach 227.7202-1 i 227.7202-4 (dla Departamentu Obrony)
tytułu 48 CFR. W odniesieniu do użytkowników końcowych, podlegających rządowi Stanów
Zjednoczonych Adobe zobowiązuje się przestrzegać wszystkich obowiązujących przepisów prawa,
dotyczących równych szans, w tym – jeżeli mają zastosowanie – przepisów Zarządzenia nr 11246
(Executive Order 11246), z późn. zm., Sekcji 402 ustawy z 1974 r. o rehabilitacji społecznej weteranów
wojny w Wietnamie (Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act, 38 USC 4212) i Sekcji 503
ustawy z 1973 r. o rehabilitacji (Rehabilitation Act 1973), z późn. zm., oraz Części 60-1 do 60-60, 60-250
oraz 60-741 tytułu 41 CFR. Klauzula o działaniach wspierających upośledzone warstwy społeczne
(affirmative action clause) oraz regulacje wskazane w poprzednim zdaniu zostają włączone przez
odniesienie do niniejszej umowy.
--- Page 334 ---
12.2 Produkty komercyjne. Dla użytkowników końcowych podlegających rządowi Stanów
Zjednoczonych Oprogramowanie spełnia kryteria „Produktu Komercyjnego” zgodnie z definicją tego
terminu podaną w tytule 48 CFR, artykuł 2.101. Składają się na nie „Komercyjne Oprogramowanie

użytkownikom końcowym na mocy niniejszej Umowy. Nieopublikowane prawa są zastrzeżone na mocy
obowiązujących w Stanach Zjednoczonych przepisów dotyczących praw autorskich.
13. Przestrzeganie warunków licencji.
Jeśli Klient jest przedsiębiorcą, spółką lub organizacją, niniejszym wyraża zgodę, by — niezależnie od
kontroli przestrzegania warunków licencji dokonywanej przez Oprogramowanie — nie częściej niż raz
na dwanaście (12) miesięcy spółka Adobe lub jej upoważniony przedstawiciel dokonali inspekcji akt,
systemów i wyposażenia Klienta w celu zweryfikowania, czy wszelkie Oprogramowanie Adobe
wykorzystywane jest zgodnie z postanowieniami ważnych licencji udzielonych przez Adobe, przy czym o
takiej inspekcji Klient zostanie powiadomiony na co najmniej siedem (7) dni roboczych przed jej
terminem. Na przykład, Adobe ma prawo dostępu do akt Klienta, na podstawie których można
stwierdzić, czy w instalacjach Oprogramowania wprowadzono numery seryjne, a Klient jest
zobowiązany do niezwłocznego udostępnienia takich akt spółce Adobe na jej żądanie. Ponadto Klient
udostępni Adobe, w ciągu trzydziestu (30) dni od złożenia stosownego wniosku przez Adobe, wszystkie
akta i informacje, jakich zażąda Adobe w celu zweryfikowania zgodności wykorzystania
oprogramowania Adobe z licencjami udzielonymi przez Adobe. Dodatkowe informacje na temat
numerów seryjnych są dostępne pod adresem http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_pl.
14. Połączenia internetowe i prywatność.
14.1 Automatyczne połączenia z Internetem. Oprogramowanie może powodować, że Komputer Klienta
będzie automatycznie, bez powiadomienia, nawiązywał połączenie z Internetem i komunikował się z
witryną internetową Adobe lub domeną Adobe między innymi w celu weryfikacji ważności licencji oraz
udostępnienia Klientowi dodatkowych informacji, opcji i funkcji. O ile w Artykułach od 14.2 do 14.7 nie
określono inaczej, do wszystkich połączeń z Internetem nawiązywanych automatycznie przez
Oprogramowanie mają zastosowanie następujące postanowienia:
14.1.1 W każdym przypadku nawiązania przez Oprogramowanie połączenia z Internetem i komunikacji
z witryną internetową Adobe, automatycznie lub na wyraźne żądanie użytkownika, mają zastosowanie
Zasady w Zakresie Ochrony Prywatności. Zasady Adobe w Zakresie Ochrony Prywatności dopuszczają
rejestrowanie odwiedzin witryny i zawierają punkt dotyczący rejestrowania i wykorzystania plików
cookie, sygnalizatorów internetowych i podobnych rozwiązań technicznych.
14.1.2 Za każdym razem, gdy Oprogramowanie łączy się z serwerami Adobe za pośrednictwem
Internetu, określone informacje o Kliencie są zbierane i przesyłane do Adobe w sposób zgodny z
Zasadami Adobe w Zakresie Ochrony Prywatności w Internecie dostępnymi pod adresem
http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_pl („Zasady Ochrony Prywatności”).
14.1.3 Jeśli Klient uzyskuje dostęp do Usługi Elektronicznej Adobe (według definicji w Artykule 16.4) lub
aktywuje bądź rejestruje Oprogramowanie, do Adobe mogą być przekazane dodatkowe informacje,
takie jak identyfikator Adobe ID Klienta, jego nazwa użytkownika i hasło; informacje te mogą być
przechowywane przez Adobe, przy czym odbywa się to zgodnie z Zasadami Ochrony Prywatności oraz
dodatkowymi warunkami używania danej Usługi Elektronicznej Adobe (łącznie z warunkami używania
witryny Adobe.com i innymi obowiązującymi warunkami, „Dodatkowymi Warunkami Używania”).
--- Page 335 ---
14.1.4 O ile jest to dozwolone z mocy właściwego prawa lub Klient wyraził na to zgodę, Adobe może
(a) wysyłać do Klienta wiadomości transakcyjne w celu usprawnienia korzystania z Usługi Elektronicznej
Adobe, aktywacji lub rejestracji Oprogramowania lub Usługi Elektronicznej Adobe, lub (b) kierować do
Klienta przekaz marketingowy wewnątrz produktów w celu informowania o Oprogramowaniu i innych
produktach i Usługach Adobe, przy czym przy kierowaniu i formułowaniu przekazu mogą być
wykorzystywane między innymi takie informacje, jak dane o wersji platformy, wersji Oprogramowana,
statusie licencji i języku instalacji.
14.2 Aktualizacja. Oprogramowanie może spowodować automatyczne (w regularnych lub
nieregularnych odstępach czasu) nawiązywanie przez Komputer Klienta, bez odrębnego
powiadomienia, połączenia z Internetem w celu (a) sprawdzania dostępności Aktualizacji do pobrania i
zainstalowania na Komputerze oraz (b) informowania Adobe o wynikach prób instalacji.
14.3 Aktywacja. Oprogramowanie może wymagać, aby Klient (a) uzyskał identyfikator Adobe ID,
(b) aktywował lub reaktywował Oprogramowanie, (c) zarejestrował Oprogramowanie lub
(d) zweryfikował ważność Członkostwa. Zastosowane w tym celu rozwiązanie techniczne może
powodować, że Komputer Klienta będzie łączył się z Internetem podczas instalowania, uruchamiania
lub później, w regularnych odstępach czasu, nie informując o tym Klienta. Po nawiązaniu połączenia
Oprogramowanie zbierze i prześle informacje do Adobe tak jak opisano to na stronie
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_pl („Warunki Aktywacji”). Adobe może także przekazywać do
Oprogramowania lub Klienta informacje związane z licencją, subskrypcją lub Członkostwem Klienta.
Adobe może wykorzystywać takie informacje do wykrywania prób użycia produktów i usług w sposób
oszukańczy bądź niezgodny z licencją, warunkami subskrypcji lub Członkostwa i zapobiegania takim
próbom. Nieaktywowanie bądź niezarejestrowanie Oprogramowania, brak weryfikacji ważności
subskrypcji lub Członkostwa lub wykrycie przez Adobe próby oszukańczego lub niezgodnego z
uprawnieniami użycia Oprogramowania może spowodować ograniczenie dostępności funkcji
Oprogramowania, brak możliwości korzystania z Oprogramowania bądź wcześniejsze zakończenie lub
zawieszenie subskrypcji lub Członkostwa.
14.4 Dezaktywacja. Klient może zdezaktywować i odinstalować Oprogramowanie z Komputera w celu
zainstalowania i aktywowania Oprogramowania na innym Komputerze zgodnie z niniejszą umową
(„Dezaktywacja”) i dodatkowymi informacjami opisanymi na stronie
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_pl. Do dezaktywacji wymagane jest połączenie z Internetem.
14.5 Korzystanie z Usług Elektronicznych. Oprogramowanie może powodować, że Komputer Klienta
będzie automatycznie, bez odrębnego powiadomienia, w regularnych lub nieregularnych odstępach
czasu nawiązywał połączenia z Internetem w celu usprawnienia dostępu Klienta do treści i usług
udostępnianych przez Adobe lub osoby trzecie, tak jak określono to w Artykule 16.4 (Usługi
elektroniczne). Ponadto Oprogramowanie może, bez odrębnego powiadomienia, automatycznie łączyć
się z Internetem w celu aktualizowania materiałów pobieranych z tych usług elektronicznych w celu
zapewnienia ich natychmiastowej dostępności także wówczas, gdy nie będzie możliwości połączenia z
Internetem.
14.6 Certyfikaty cyfrowe. W Oprogramowaniu stosowane są certyfikaty cyfrowe (zob. Artykuł 16.5)
ułatwiające Klientowi identyfikację pobieranych plików (np. aplikacji i treści) oraz wydawców tych
plików. Na przykład w środowisku Adobe AIR stosowane są certyfikaty cyfrowe ułatwiające Klientowi
identyfikację wydawcy aplikacji Adobe AIR W produktach z rodziny Adobe Acrobat stosowane są
certyfikaty cyfrowe służące do podpisywania dokumentów „PDF” (Portable Document Format) i
sprawdzania ważności podpisów w takich dokumentach oraz do sprawdzania ważności certyfikowanych
dokumentów PDF. Podczas sprawdzania ważności certyfikatu cyfrowego Komputer Klienta może
nawiązać połączenie z Internetem.
14.7 Menedżer ustawień. Oprogramowanie może zawierać odtwarzacz Flash Player. Odtwarzacz Flash
Player może powodować zapamiętanie niektórych ustawień użytkownika na Komputerze Klienta w
postaci lokalnego obiektu udostępnionego. Są one powiązane z konkretną instancją programu Flash
Player na Komputerze i pozwalają Klientowi na dostosowywanie funkcji środowiska wykonawczego.
--- Page 336 ---
Menedżer ustawień programu Flash Player umożliwia Klientowi modyfikowanie takich ustawień, a w
szczególności ograniczenie możliwości zapisywania lokalnych obiektów udostępnionych przez
podmioty trzecie lub zezwolenie treści podmiotów trzecich na dostęp do mikrofonu i kamery
komputera Klienta. Dodatkowe informacje na temat konfigurowania ustawień w danej wersji programu
Flash Player, włącznie z instrukcją wyłączania opcji zapamiętywania lokalnych obiektów
udostępnionych w Menedżerze ustawień programu Flash Player, można znaleźć pod adresem
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_pl. Dodatkowe informacje na temat lokalnych obiektów
udostępnionych można znaleźć pod adresem http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_pl.
15. Komunikacja miedzy węzłami równorzędnymi.
Oprogramowanie może bez odrębnego powiadamiania wykorzystać połączenie Klienta z siecią lokalną
do automatycznego nawiązywania połączeń z innymi programami Adobe, a tym samym ujawnić w sieci
lokalnej swoją gotowość do komunikacji z innymi programami Adobe. W ramach takich połączeń może
być przesyłany Adres IP stacji Klienta w sieci lokalnej.
16. Postanowienia szczególne i wyjątki.
Niniejszy artykuł zawiera postanowienia szczególne związane z pewnymi produktami i komponentami
Oprogramowania, a także nieliczne wyjątki od powyższych warunków i zasad. O ile jakiekolwiek
postanowienie niniejszego artykułu będzie pozostawać w sprzeczności z innymi warunkami niniejszej
umowy, warunki i postanowienia niniejszego artykułu będą mieć charakter rozstrzygający.
16.1 Brak ograniczeń uprawnień ustawowych; postanowienia właściwe dla Europejskiego Obszaru
Gospodarczego; informacje wymagane prawnie w Australii.
16.1.1 Niniejsza umowa nie powoduje ograniczenia praw ustawowych przysługujących jakiejkolwiek
stronie, w tym będącej nabywcą indywidualnym. Na przykład w przypadku nabywców z Nowej Zelandii,
którzy zakupili Oprogramowanie do celów osobistych lub domowych (a nie do celów związanych z
prowadzeniem działalności gospodarczej), niniejsza umowa podlega postanowieniom ustawy o
gwarancjach dla klientów (Consumer Garantees Act).
16.1.2 Jeśli Klient nabył Oprogramowanie w Europejskim Obszarze Gospodarczym (EOG), jest
rezydentem EOG i jest konsumentem (tj. używa Oprogramowania do celów prywatnych, niezwiązanych
z działalnością gospodarczą), to Artykuł 6 (Ograniczona Gwarancja) nie ma zastosowania do zakupu i
użytkowania Oprogramowania przez Klienta. W takim przypadku Adobe gwarantuje, że przez okres 2 lat
od zakupu Oprogramowanie będzie zapewniało funkcje opisane w odpowiednim podręczniku
użytkownika („uzgodnione funkcje”), pod warunkiem używania go na Komputerze Kompatybilnym.
Odstępstwa od uzgodnionej funkcjonalności niebędące odstępstwami zasadniczymi nie są podstawą do
roszczeń gwarancyjnych. NINIEJSZA GWARANCJA NIE OBEJMUJE OPROGRAMOWANIA, Z KTÓREGO
KLIENT KORZYSTA JAKO Z WERSJI ZAPOZNAWCZEJ, PRÓBNEJ, STARTOWEJ, DEMONSTRACYJNEJ ANI
OPROGRAMOWANIA CZCIONKI. NIE OBEJMUJE TAKŻE AWARII OPROGRAMOWANIA
SPOWODOWANYCH JEGO MODYFIKACJĄ PRZEZ KLIENTA. Aby zgłosić roszczenie gwarancyjne, należy
powiadomić o nim Dział Obsługi Klienta Adobe we wspomnianym okresie 2 lat, przedstawiając
szczegółowy dowód zakupu Oprogramowania. Adobe w porozumieniu z Klientem zweryfikuje, czy w
Oprogramowaniu występuje defekt, a w razie potrzeby poinformuje Klienta, że błąd wystąpił, ponieważ
Klient nie zainstalował Oprogramowania prawidłowo (w takim przypadku spółka Adobe udzieli
Klientowi stosownej pomocy). Jeśli w Oprogramowaniu występuje defekt, Klient może zażądać od firmy
Adobe zwrotu zapłaconej kwoty lub naprawionego bądź zastępczego egzemplarza Oprogramowania.
Do żądania musi być dołączony dowód zakupu. Jeśli roszczenie gwarancyjne jest uzasadnione, spółka
Adobe spełni żądanie Klienta, dostarczając naprawione bądź zastępcze Oprogramowanie, jeśli jednak
taki sposób spełnienia żądania będzie nieracjonalny z punktu widzenia firmy Adobe, spółka Adobe
zwróci Klientowi zapłaconą kwotę. W sprawie pomocy dotyczącej obsługi roszczeń gwarancyjnych
należy zwracać się do Działu Obsługi Klienta Adobe.
--- Page 337 ---
Należy zwrócić uwagę, że postanowienia Artykułu 8 (Ograniczenie odpowiedzialności) pozostają w
mocy w odniesieniu do wszelkich roszczeń zgłaszanych przez Klienta w związku z używaniem
Oprogramowania. Niezależnie od tego, jeśli spółka Adobe naruszy warunki niniejszej umowy, będzie
ponosić odpowiedzialność za szkody bezpośrednie, które w racjonalnym zakresie można było
przewidzieć. Klienta informuje się niniejszym o konieczności podjęcia wszelkich racjonalnych kroków
mających na celu uniknięcie i ograniczenie szkód, w szczególności tworzenie kopii zapasowych
Oprogramowania i własnych danych komputerowych.
Niniejsza umowa, a w szczególności niniejszy Artykuł 16.1.2, opisuje uprawnienia (w tym uprawnienia
ustawowe) Klienta przysługujące w razie wystąpienia problemów z użytkowaniem Oprogramowania.
Jeśli uprawnienia ustawowe są większe od opisanych tutaj, to mają moc obowiązującą.
16.1.3 Żadne z postanowień niniejszej umowy (w tym Artykuł 4.4) nie ogranicza niepodlegających
uchyleniu praw do dekompilacji Oprogramowania, jakie przysługują Klientowi z mocy obowiązujących
przepisów. Na przykład Klienci w Unii Europejskiej (UE) mają w określonych warunkach prawo do
dekompilacji Oprogramowania, jeśli jest to niezbędne do zapewnienia jego współdziałania z innym
oprogramowaniem, a Klient wcześniej zwrócił się pisemnie do Adobe o udostępnienie informacji
niezbędnych do uzyskania takiego współdziałania, zaś spółka Adobe nie udostępniła takich informacji.
Ponadto dekompilacja może być dokonywana tylko przez Klienta lub inną osobę uprawnioną do
używania kopii Oprogramowania w imieniu Klienta. Adobe ma prawo ustalić zasadne warunki przed
przekazaniem takich informacji. Wszelkie takie informacje przekazane przez Adobe oraz wszelkie
informacje uzyskane przez Klienta w drodze powyższego zezwolenia mogą być wykorzystywane przez
Klienta wyłącznie do celów określonych w niniejszej umowie i nie mogą być ujawniane żadnym
osobom trzecim, ani wykorzystywane do tworzenia jakiegokolwiek oprogramowania zasadniczo
podobnego w wyglądzie i działaniu do Oprogramowania, ani też do innych działań naruszających prawa
autorskie Adobe i jej licencjodawców.
16.1.4 Jeśli Klient nabywa Oprogramowanie w Australii, obowiązuje następujące postanowienie,
niezależnie od jakichkolwiek postanowień Umowy stanowiących inaczej:

zadzwonić do Działu Obsługi Klienta Adobe pod numer 1800 614 863 i podać informacje o produkcie,
jego numer seryjny oraz dane dowodu zakupu. W takim przypadku konieczne może być odesłanie
produktu (oprogramowania) na podany przez nas adres, na koszt konsumenta. Świadczenia z tytułu tej
gwarancji uzupełniają pozostałe prawa i możliwe środki zaradcze przysługujące konsumentowi z mocy
prawa.
16.2 Dodatkowe warunki dotyczące Wersji Zapoznawczej Oprogramowania. Niniejszy artykuł stosuje się
do Oprogramowania będącego oprogramowaniem w wersji zapoznawczej lub w wersji beta („Wersja
Zapoznawcza Oprogramowania”). Wersja Zapoznawcza Oprogramowania nie stanowi ostatecznego
produktu Adobe, może zawierać defekty, błędy oraz powodować inne problemy, które mogą
skutkować awariami sytemu lub innymi awariami oraz utratą danych. Adobe ma prawo nie zdecydować
się na wprowadzenie Wersji Zapoznawczej Oprogramowania do obrotu handlowego. Jeżeli Klient
otrzymał Wersję Zapoznawczą Oprogramowania na podstawie odrębnej umowy, takiej jak Umowa
Licencyjna na Wersję Zapoznawczą Oprogramowania Adobe Systems Incorporated, korzystanie z
--- Page 338 ---
Oprogramowania przez Klienta również podlega takiej umowie. Na wezwanie Adobe lub w chwili
wprowadzenia takiego Oprogramowania do obrotu handlowego Klient niezwłocznie zwróci lub zniszczy
wszystkie kopie Wersji Zapoznawczej Oprogramowania. KLIENT KORZYSTA Z WERSJI ZAPOZNAWCZEJ

Internet no momento da validação de um certificado digital.
14.7 Gerenciador de Configurações. O software poderá incluir o Flash Player. O Flash Player pode salvar
determinadas configurações do usuário armazenando-as no Computador do Cliente como um objeto
local compartilhado. Elas são associadas à instância do Flash Player no Computador, permitindo ao

Player permite ao Cliente modificar essas configurações, incluindo a capacidade para limitar que
terceiros armazenem objetos compartilhados locais ou conceda ao conteúdo de terceiros o direito de
cesso ao microfone e à câmera do computador. Informações adicionais sobre como configurar
definições na sua versão do Flash Player, incluindo informações sobre objetos compartilhados locais

16.1 Proibição de prejudicialidade; Disposições da área econômica europeia; Aviso australiano
obrigatório.
16.1.1 Este contrato não prejudicará os direitos legais de qualquer uma das partes, incluindo as que
estiverem negociando na condição de consumidor. Por exemplo, para os consumidores na Nova
Zelândia que obtiverem o software para uso pessoal, doméstico ou particular (sem fins comerciais), este
contrato estará sujeito à Lei de garantia ao consumidor (Consumer Guarantees Act).
16.1.2 Se o Cliente adquiriu o Software na Área Econômica Europeia (EEA), o Cliente geralmente reside
na EEA e o Cliente é um consumidor (que o uso do Software é para fins pessoais e não comerciais),
então a Seção 6 (Garantia Limitada) não se aplica á compra do Cliente e o uso do Software. Nesses
casos, a Adobe garante por um período de 2 anos após a aquisição que o Software fornecerás as
funcionalidades especificadas no manual do usuário aplicável (as “funcionalidades previstas”) quando
utilizado em Computador compatível. A variação não substancial das funcionalidades previstas não
estabelecerá quaisquer direitos de garantia. ESSA GARANTIA NÃO SE APLICA AO SOFTWARE QUE O
CLIENTE USA EM UM TESTE DE PRÉ-LANÇAMENTO, PARA INICIANTE OU DE AMOSTRA USADO, OU
AO SOFTWARE-FONTE CONVERTIDO EM OUTROS FORMATOS OU NO CASO DE O SOFTWARE
PARAR DE FUNCIONAR POR TER SIDO ALTERADO PELO CLIENTE. Para fazer uma reclamação
referente à garantia, o Cliente deve notificar o Departamento de suporte ao cliente da Adobe durante
esse período de dois (2) anos e fornecer detalhes da nota fiscal da compra do Software. A Adobe
confirmará com o Cliente se houver um defeito no software ou informará que o erro ocorreu porque o
cliente não instalou o software corretamente (nesse caso, a Adobe fornecerá assistência ao Cliente).
Caso haja um defeito no software, o Cliente poderá solicitar à Adobe um reembolso, um reparo ou uma
nova cópia do Software. As solicitações deverão ser acompanhadas da nota fiscal de compra. Se os
detalhes de garantia procederem, a Adobe atenderá a solicitação do Cliente e fornecerá um software
reparado ou uma troca do software, salvo se tal condição não for razoável para a Adobe. Nesse caso,
um reembolso será fornecido ao Cliente. Para obter ajuda sobre garantia, entre em contato com o
Departamento de suporte ao cliente da Adobe.
Observe que as disposições da Cláusula 8 (Limitação de responsabilidade) continuarão aplicáveis a
quaisquer reclamações referentes a danos feitas pelo Cliente em relação ao uso do Software. Não
obstante, a Adobe será responsável por perdas diretas que forem razoavelmente previsíveis no caso de
violação deste contrato por parte da Adobe. Recomenda-se que o Cliente tome todas as medidas
razoáveis para evitar e reduzir danos, especialmente através de cópias de backup do Software e dos
dados do seu computador.
Este contrato e a Seção 16.1.2 em particular têm a finalidade de descrever os direitos do Cliente
(incluindo seus direitos legais) para o caso de haver problemas com seu uso do Software. Caso os
direitos legais do Clientes se sobreponham a essa descrição, tais direitos deverão prevalecer.
16.1.3 Nenhuma disposição inclusa neste contrato (incluindo a Seção 4.4) limitará qualquer direito não
renunciável que o Cliente possa ter de descompilar o Software de acordo com a lei vigente. Por
exemplo, se o Cliente estiver localizado na União Européia (EU), ele pode ter o direito, sob certas
condições especificadas na legislação vigente, de descompilar o Software se for essencial fazê-lo a fim
de obter operabilidade do Software com outro programa, tendo primeiramente solicitado por escrito à
Adobe o fornecimento das informações necessárias à obtenção de tal operabilidade, e a Adobe não
tenha disponibilizado tais informações. Além disso, essa descompilação poderá ser realizada somente
pelo Cliente ou por alguém que tenha sido designado a usar o software em seu nome. A Adobe
reserva-se o direito de impor condições razoáveis antes de fornecer esse tipo de informação. Quaisquer
informações fornecidas pela Adobe ou obtidas pelo Cliente, conforme previsto neste instrumento,
poderão ser usadas por ele somente com a finalidade descrita neste instrumento e não poderão ser
divulgadas a terceiros ou usadas para a criação de qualquer software que seja substancialmente similar
à expressão do software nem usadas para quaisquer outros fins que violem os direitos autorais da
Adobe ou de seus licenciados.

16.1.4 Se o Cliente obtiver o Software na Austrália, então a seguinte disposição poderá ser aplicada, não
obstante aquilo indicado em contrário neste Contrato:
AVISO A CONSUMIDORES NA AUSTRÁLIA:
Nossas mercadorias são fornecidas com garantias que não podem ser excluídas da Lei Australiana ao
Consumidor. Você terá o direito a uma substituição ou a um reembolso no caso de uma grande falha e
como compensação por qualquer outra perda ou dano relativamente previsíveis. Você também terá o
direito a ter a mercadoria reparada ou substituída se a mercadoria não apresentar uma qualidade
aceitável e se a falha não equivaler a uma grande falha. Nossos produtos de software também são
fornecidos com uma garantia limitada de 90 dias oferecida pela Systems Software Ireland Limited, com

16.2 Termos adicionais aplicáveis ao software de pré-lançamento. Se o software for uma versão de pré-
comercialização ou uma versão Beta (“software de pré-lançamento”), esta cláusula será aplicável. O
Software é uma versão de pré-lançamento, não representa o produto final da Adobe, e poderá conter
bugs, erros e outros problemas que poderão causar falhas no sistema e perda de dados. A Adobe pode
nunca lançar no mercado um software de pré-lançamento. Caso o Cliente receba o Software de pré-
lançamento de acordo com um contrato escrito separado, como o Contrato de Licença para software
de pré-lançamento da Adobe Systems Incorporated, o uso do Cliente do software também será regido
pelo referido contrato. O Cliente deverá devolver ou destruir imediatamente todas as cópias do
software de pré-lançamento mediante solicitação prévia da Adobe ou após o lançamento comercial do
referido software. O CLIENTE É INTEIRAMENTE RESPONSÁVEL PELO USO DE SOFTWARE DE PRÉ-
LANÇAMENTO. CONSULTE A SEÇÕES 6 E 8 SOBRE ISENÇÕES DE GARANTIA E LIMITAÇÕES DE
RESPONSABILIDADE QUE REGEM O SOFTWARE DE PRÉ-LANÇAMENTO.
16.3 Produto de software educacional. Se o software for um Produto de software educacional (software
fabricado e distribuído para uso exclusivo de Usuários finais da área de educação), o Cliente poderá usar
o software somente se estiver qualificado em sua jurisdição como um Usuário final da área de
educação. Visite http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_br para saber mais sobre elegibilidade.

sido oferecido anteriormente sem custos. A Seção 14 destaca informações importantes com relação à
conectividade com a Internet e a privacidade do Cliente. Conforme estabelecido na Seção 14, quando o
Software acesa um Serviço on-line da Adobe, o uso de tal serviço é regido pela Política de Privacidade

2. Лицензия на Программное обеспечение; членство.
2.1 Лицензия на Программное обеспечение. Настоящий пункт 2.1 распространяется на Клиентов,
которые приобрели лицензию на Программное обеспечение, но не приобрели лицензию или
услугу, основанную на членстве, например, членство в сервисе Creative Cloud (как описано в
разделе 2.2).
2.1.1 Предоставление лицензии. При условии соблюдения Клиентом условий настоящего
Договора и уплаты соответствующего лицензионного вознаграждения, Adobe предоставляет
Клиенту неисключительную и ограниченную лицензию на установку и использование
Программного обеспечения: (a) на территории или в регионе, где Клиент получил Программное
обеспечение от Adobe или уполномоченного реселлера Adobe или иным образом, как указано в
Документации («Территория»), (b) в течение срока действия такой лицензии («Срок действия»)
(c) в соответствии с объемом лицензии данного типа и без превышения разрешенного числа
совместимых компьютеров Клиента, как указано в Документации, и (d) в соответствии с
условиями настоящего Договора и применимой Документации. Если иное не указано в
настоящем Договоре, применимой Документации или в момент приобретения, Срок действия
лицензии не ограничивается. После истечения или прекращения Срока действия лицензии
Программное обеспечение может полностью или частично прекратить работу без
предварительного уведомления. После истечения или прекращения Срока действия лицензии
Клиент не имеет права использовать Программное обеспечение, если он не возобновит
лицензию. Предоставляемая здесь лицензия дополняется соответствующими положениями

шрифтовое программное обеспечение, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash
Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite и Adobe Runtimes.
--- Page 364 ---
2.1.2 Типы лицензий.
2.1.2.1 Программное обеспечение, не имеющее серийного номера. Программное обеспечение
или его части, которые предоставляются без серийного номера, в течение Срока действия
лицензии можно устанавливать и использовать на любых Совместимых компьютерах, число
которых соответствует плану развертывания компьютеров в организации в течение Срока
действия лицензии, исключительно в целях демонстрации, оценки и обучения, и только если
Выходные файлы и другие материалы, полученные в результате такого использования,
применяются для внутренних, некоммерческих и непроизводственных целей. ПРОГРАММНОЕ
ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЕ, НЕ ИМЕЮЩЕЕ СЕРИЙНОГО НОМЕРА, ПОСТАВЛЯЕТСЯ В СОСТОЯНИИ «КАК
ЕСТЬ». ДОСТУП К ЛЮБЫМ ВЫХОДНЫМ ФАЙЛАМ, СОЗДАННЫМ С ПОМОЩЬЮ ПРОГРАММНОГО
ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЯ БЕЗ СЕРИЙНОГО НОМЕРА, И ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЕ ТАКИХ ФАЙЛОВ
ОСУЩЕСТВЛЯЕТСЯ ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО НА СОБСТВЕННЫЙ РИСК КЛИЕНТА.
2.1.2.2 Оцениваемое программное обеспечение. Программное обеспечение или его части,
которые имеют серийный номер и снабжены обозначением «for evaluation purposes» («для
целей оценки») или иным аналогичным обозначением (например, если Программное
обеспечение или его серийный номер поставляются с обозначением «EVAL» по отдельному
договору) (далее – «Оцениваемое Программное обеспечение»), можно устанавливать и
использовать на Компьютерах только в целях демонстрации, оценки и обучения, и только в том
случае, если Выходные файлы и другие материалы, полученные в результате такого
использования, применяются для внутренних, некоммерческих и непроизводственных целей.
ОЦЕНИВАЕМОЕ ПРОГРАММНОЕ ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЕ ПОСТАВЛЯЕТСЯ В СОСТОЯНИИ «КАК ЕСТЬ».
ДОСТУП КЛИЕНТА К ЛЮБЫМ ВЫХОДНЫМ ФАЙЛАМ, СОЗДАННЫМ С ПОМОЩЬЮ
ОЦЕНИВАЕМОГО ПРОГРАММНОГО ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЯ, И ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЕ ТАКИХ ФАЙЛОВ
ОСУЩЕСТВЛЯЕТСЯ ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО НА СОБСТВЕННЫЙ РИСК КЛИЕНТА.
2.1.2.3 Подписное издание. Если Программное обеспечение предоставляется по подписке
(«Подписное издание»), то Клиент может устанавливать и использовать Подписное издание
только на Разрешенном числе совместимых компьютеров в течение Срока действия лицензии. С
учетом Разрешенного числа компьютеров для Подписных изданий, Adobe может разрешить
Клиенту установить и использовать последнюю предыдущую версию Подписного издания и
текущую версию Подписного издания на одном и том же Компьютере в течение Срока действия
лицензии. Клиент соглашается с тем, что Adobe может в любое время изменить тип включенного
в Подписное издание Программного обеспечения (например, конкретные компоненты, версии,
платформы, языки и т. п.) и не будет нести какой бы то ни было материальной ответственности
перед Клиентом в связи с таким изменением. Для продолжения доступа к Подписному изданию
требуется: (a) периодическая связь по Интернету для активации, возобновления и удостоверения
подлинности лицензии, (b) получение компанией Adobe или ее уполномоченным реселлером
периодических платежей за подписку, и (c) согласие Клиента с условиями подписки и (или)
прочими дополнительными условиями, которые помещены на сайте
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_ru или сообщены во время приобретения. Если Adobe не
будет получать периодические платежи за подписку или не сможет периодически удостоверять
подлинность подписки, то Программное обеспечение без дополнительного уведомления может
быть приведено в неработоспособное состояние до того момента, когда Adobe получит платеж
или сможет удостовериться в подлинности лицензии.
2.1.3 Использование на портативном или домашнем компьютере. С учетом ограничений,
указанных в пункте 2.1.4, первичный пользователь Компьютера, на котором установлено
Программное обеспечение согласно пункту 2.1 («Первичный пользователь»), может
установить вторую копию Программного обеспечения исключительно для собственного
пользования на портативном или домашнем Компьютере, при условии, что Программное
обеспечение на портативном или домашнем Компьютере не используется одновременно с
Программным обеспечением, установленном на первичном Компьютере.
--- Page 365 ---
2.1.4 Ограничения на вторичное использование держателями лицензии на определенное число
пользователей. Если Программное обеспечение было получено по программе корпоративного
лицензирования Adobe (в настоящее время именуемой Adobe Volume Licensing) любым
держателем лицензии, кроме держателей учебной корпоративной лицензии, вторая копия
Программного обеспечения, созданная в соответствии с пунктом 2.1.3, должна быть
использована исключительно в интересах и в процессе хозяйственной деятельности,
осуществляемой держателем корпоративной лицензии.
2.1.5 Платформа с двойной загрузкой. Программное обеспечение лицензировано для
использования на конкретной платформе операционной системы. Для использования
Программного обеспечения на каждой платформе операционной системы Клиент должен
приобрести отдельную лицензию. Например, если Клиент желает установить Программное
обеспечение на платформах операционных систем Mac и Windows, которые одновременно
установлены на одном устройстве (т. е. на компьютере с двойной загрузкой), то сначала Клиент
должен приобрести две отдельные лицензии на Программное обеспечение. Это требование
необходимо выполнять даже в том случае, если две версии Программного обеспечения, каждая
из которых предназначена для разных платформ операционных систем, поставлены Клиенту на
одном носителе.
2.1.6 Распространение через Сервер. Как разрешается Документацией, Клиент может копировать
образ Программного обеспечения на компьютерный файловый сервер в пределах своей
Внутренней сети (далее – «Сервер») в целях загрузки и установки Программного обеспечения на
Компьютеры в пределах той же Внутренней сети для использования исключительно в
соответствии с положениями настоящего пункта 2.
2.1.7 Использование на сервере.
2.1.7.1 Как это разрешается отдельным документом на закупку или Документацией, и с учетом
лицензионных ограничений, оговоренных в настоящем Договоре, Клиент может устанавливать
Программное обеспечение на Сервер исключительно с целью предоставления любому лицу с
Компьютером, находящимся в той же Внутренней сети («Пользователь сети»), возможностей для
доступа к Программному обеспечению и его использования. Пользователь сети, имеющий
доступ к этому Программному обеспечению на Сервере именуется «Пользователем
программного обеспечения с сервера». Общее количество Пользователей программного
обеспечения с сервера (но не количество параллельных пользователей) не может превышать
Разрешенного числа. Например, если Клиент приобрел 10 лицензий на Программное
обеспечение (Разрешенное число равно 10) и установил Программное обеспечение на Сервер,
то не более 10 Пользователей программного обеспечения с сервера могут получить доступ к
Программному обеспечению (даже если у Клиента имеется более 10 Пользователей сети или
менее 10 параллельных пользователей Программного обеспечения).
2.1.7.2 В целях уточнения и без ограничений, в соответствии с вышесказанным Клиенту не
разрешается устанавливать Программное обеспечение или получать к нему доступ (будь то
напрямую или путем передачи команд, данных или инструкций): (a) с Компьютера или на
Компьютер, который не является частью Внутренней сети Клиента; (b) для обеспечения
функционирования рабочих групп на основе веб-хостинга или общедоступных сервисов на
основе веб-хостинга; (c) любым физическим или юридическим лицом, не имеющим лицензии на
использование, загрузку, копирование и иное применение функциональных возможностей
Программного обеспечения при отсутствии соответствующих лицензий, выданных компанией
Adobe; (d) в качестве компонента системы, потока документооборота или услуги, доступной
количеству пользователей, превышающему Разрешенное число; или (e) для операций, не
инициируемых индивидуальным пользователем (например при автоматизированной серверной
обработке).
--- Page 366 ---
2.2 Членство. Настоящий пункт 2.2 распространяется на Клиентов, которые приобрели лицензию
или услугу, основанную на членстве, например, членство в сервисе Creative Cloud (совместно
именуется «Членство»).
2.2.1 Онлайн-услуги Adobe, связанные с Членством. При условии соблюдения Клиентом
требований настоящего Договора и уплаты им соответствующих членских взносов (если
предусмотрены), Adobe предоставляет Клиенту неисключительное и ограниченное право
доступа и право использования Программного обеспечения и связанных с ним Онлайн-услуг
Adobe на Территории (как более подробно описано в пункте 16.4.1) в рамках Членства, с учетом

(b) в течение периода наличия и действия Членства («Период членства») и (c) в соответствии с
условиями настоящего Договора и применимой Документации. По истечении или прекращении
Периода членства: (x) Программное обеспечение может полностью или частично прекратить
работу без предварительного уведомления, и (y) Клиент не сможет использовать Программное
обеспечение, если он не возобновит членство. Все условия, относящиеся к данному
Программному обеспечению в соответствии с требованиями настоящего Договора, сохранят
свою силу и будут по-прежнему применяться в отношении Клиента и использования
Программного обеспечения Клиентом.
2.2.3 Ограничения. Клиент соглашается на следующие дополнительные условия и ограничения,
относящиеся к Членству. (a) Adobe может в любое время изменить тип предоставляемого в
рамках Членства Программного обеспечения (например, конкретные продукты, компоненты,
версии, платформы, языки и т. п.), и не будет нести какой бы то ни было материальной
ответственности перед Клиентом в связи с таким изменением; (b) в течение Периода членства
может потребоваться, чтобы Клиент подключался к Интернету и регистрировал вход в систему;
(c) Программное обеспечение в любое время и без уведомления может автоматически
подключаться к Интернету для проверки Членства Клиента; и (d) Клиент не должен дозволять
или разрешать другим лицам использовать Программное обеспечение в качестве Клиента.
2.3 Файлы контента. Если иное не предусмотрено файлами «Read Me», Документацией или
другими лицензиями, связанными с Файлами контента, Клиенту разрешается использование,
отображение, воспроизведение и распространение любых Файлов контента. Однако Клиент не
может распространять Файлы контента в автономном порядке (например, в тех случаях, когда
Файлы контента представляют собой основную ценность распространяемого продукта) и
претендовать на какие-либо права на товарный знак в отношении Файлов контента или
производных работ с их использованием. Никакие положения настоящего документа не влияют
на право собственности на Программное обеспечение, как указано в пункте 3.
2.4 Примеры Программного кода. Разрешается модификация исходного кода или компонентов
Программного обеспечения, в явной форме идентифицированных в сопроводительной
Документации как образец кода, образец программного кода, фрагменты кода, файлы класса
ActionScript или образцы компонентов (каждый из них именуется «Образец программного
кода») исключительно в целях разработки и тестирования веб-сайтов и приложений, созданных
с применением программ Adobe; при условии, что Клиенту разрешается копирование и
распространение Образцов программного кода (модифицированного или
немодифицированного), но только при соблюдении следующих условий: (a) Клиент может
распространять компиляции Образца программного кода в версии объектного кода только
вместе с соответствующим приложением; (b) Клиенту не разрешается включать Образец
программного кода в любые продукты или приложения, предназначенные для разработки веб-

оградить и защитить компанию Adobe от ответственности и компенсировать ее ущерб в связи с
любыми убытками, требованиями о возмещении ущерба, претензиями или судебными исками
(включая гонорары юристов), которые могут возникнуть в результате использования или
распространения его приложения.
2.5 Языки программирования. Программное обеспечение может содержать части комплектов
ExtendScript SDK и Pixel Bender SDK (SDК – комплект для разработчика программного
обеспечения). С учетом ограничений, изложенных в настоящем пункте 2, компания Adobe
предоставляет Клиенту неисключительную, непередаваемую, безвозмездную лицензию на
использование комплектов ExtendScript SDK и Pixel Bender SDK исключительно в целях
внутренней разработки прикладных программ, которые предназначены для работы вместе с
продуктами компании Adobe. За исключением случаев, явно указанных в настоящем пункте 2.5,
запрещается изменять или распространять любые части комплектов ExtendScript SDK или Pixel

3. Права на интеллектуальную собственность.
Программное обеспечение и его любые разрешенные копии, сделанные Клиентом, представляют
собой объекты интеллектуальной собственности, права на которые принадлежат корпорации
Adobe Systems Incorporated и ее поставщикам. Структура, построение и исходный код
Программного обеспечения являются ценной конфиденциальной информацией и представляют
собой коммерческую тайну корпорации Adobe Systems Incorporated и ее поставщиков.
Программное обеспечение защищено законом, включая, помимо прочего, законы об авторских
правах Соединенных Штатов Америки и других государств, а также международные договоры.
Если прямо не оговорено иное, настоящий договор не предоставляет Клиенту никаких прав
интеллектуальной собственности на Программное обеспечение. Все права, за исключением
предоставленных в явно выраженной форме, сохраняются за компанией Adobe и ее
поставщиками.
4. Ограничения и требования.
4.1 Уведомления об авторских правах. Любая изготовленная Клиентом разрешенная копия
Программного обеспечения (включая, помимо прочего, копию Документации) должна

активации, описанного на сайте http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ru. Adobe может
аннулировать лицензию, предоставленную в соответствии с настоящим документом, либо
приостановить Членство или доступ к Онлайн-услугам Adobe, если Adobe установит, что Клиент
использует программное обеспечение или Онлайн-услуги Adobe за пределами Территории.
5. Обновленные версии.
Если Программное обеспечение представляет собой Обновленную версию какой-либо
предыдущей версии программного обеспечения Adobe («Предыдущая версия»), то Клиент
сможет использовать эту Обновленную версию только при условии, что он сохранит
Предыдущую версию. Поэтому при передаче Обновленной версии в установленном порядке,
описанном в пункте 4.6, Клиент обязан также передать вместе с ней и Предыдущую версию. Если
Клиент хочет использовать Обновленную версию в дополнение к Предыдущей версии, то такое
использование разрешается только на том же Компьютере, на котором установлена и
используется Предыдущая версия. Любые обязательства Adobe по поддержке Предыдущей
версии в течение Срока действия лицензии могут быть прекращены после выпуска данной
Обновленной версии. Никакие иные виды пользования Обновленной версией не разрешаются.
Компания Adobe может выдать Клиенту лицензию на Дополнительные обновленные версии с
дополнительными или измененными условиями.
6. Ограниченная гарантия.
Если иное не оговорено в отдельном соглашении между компанией Adobe и держателем
лицензии на Программное обеспечение, Adobe гарантирует физическому или юридическому
лицу, впервые приобретающему лицензию на использование Программного обеспечения в
соответствии с условиями настоящего договора, что Программное обеспечение будет
действовать в основном в соответствии с его инструкцией по эксплуатации в течение
(a) 90 (девяноста) дней или (b) Срока действия лицензии после его получения, если этот срок
будет короче («Гарантийный период») при условии использования на Совместимом
компьютере. Несущественные отличия в характеристиках по сравнению с указанными в
инструкции по эксплуатации не приводят к возникновению права на гарантию. Данная
ограниченная гарантия не применима к следующим компонентам, которые предоставляются на
условиях «КАК ЕСТЬ» и не покрываются гарантией компании Adobe: (i) «патчи», (ii) шрифтовое
программное обеспечение; (iii) предварительные версии программного обеспечения, пробные,
начальные, оценочные, предоставленные в качестве образца, Оцениваемое программное

Документов (см. пункт 16); и (vi) любое программное обеспечение, бесплатно предоставляемое
компанией Adobe для загрузки с веб-сайта Adobe. Все гарантийные рекламации должны быть
предъявлены (вместе с доказательством покупки) в Отдел по обслуживанию клиентов компании
Adobe в течение Гарантийного периода. Дополнительную информацию относительно
гарантийных рекламаций см. на сайте http://www.adobe.com/go/support_ru. Вся ответственность
компании Adobe и ее аффилированных лиц в связи с такими гарантийными рекламациями и
единственное и исключительное средство правовой защиты Клиента по любой гарантии
ограничивается (по усмотрению Adobe): поддержкой Программного обеспечения на основании
гарантийной рекламации, заменой Программного обеспечения, или (если поддержка или замена,
по мнению Adobe, будут практически нецелесообразными) возвратом любого лицензионного
вознаграждения, которое Клиент уплатил за Программное обеспечение (если это имело место).

право Японии) и компетентные суды Лондона, Англия (в случае, если применяется право Англии
и Уэльса), имеют неисключительную юрисдикцию в отношении всех споров, относящихся к
настоящему договору. Если применяется право Сингапура, все споры, вытекающие из
настоящего договора или в связи с ним, включая любые вопросы относительно его
существования, действительности или прекращения действия, подлежат рассмотрению и
разрешению в арбитражном суде в Сингапуре в соответствии с действующим Арбитражным
регламентом Международного арбитражного центра Сингапура (SIAC), причем данный
регламент считается включенным в положения настоящего пункта посредством ссылки.
Арбитраж проводится одним арбитром, который совместно выбирается сторонами. Если арбитр
не выбран в течение 30 (тридцати) дней с момента письменного запроса любой стороны о
передаче спора в арбитражный суд, такой арбитр назначается Председателем SIAC.
Арбитражный процесс проводится на английском языке. Независимо от любого положения
настоящего соглашения, Adobe или Клиент имеют право обратиться в законодательный,
административный или какой-либо другой орган власти для принятия обеспечительных или
охранительных мер, включая судебный запрет, реальное исполнение или другие средства
защиты по праву справедливости, перед передачей дела на рассмотрение в правовое
учреждение или арбитражный суд или во время судебного разбирательства для защиты прав и
интересов или применения определенных условий, соответствующих обеспечительным мерам.
На данный договор не распространяются нижеуказанные правовые нормы, применение которых
настоящим прямо исключается: (x) коллизионные нормы права любой страны; (y) положения
Конвенции ООН о международных договорах купли-продажи товаров и (z) единый закон о
сделках с компьютерной информацией, введенный в действие в любой стране.
11. Общие положения.
Если какая-либо часть настоящего договора признается ничтожной и не имеющей исковой силы,
это не влияет на юридическую действительность остальных положений настоящего договора,
которые продолжают оставаться юридически действительным и сохраняют исковую силу в
соответствии с условиями договора. Изменения в настоящий договор могут быть внесены лишь в
письменной форме за подписью уполномоченного должностного лица компании Adobe. При
толковании настоящего договора используется его версия на английском языке. Настоящий
текст представляет собой полное соглашение между компанией Adobe и Клиентом в отношении
Программного обеспечения и отменяет все предыдущие заверения, обсуждения, обязательства,
корреспонденцию и рекламные акции, относящиеся к Программному обеспечению.

Вьетнаме» (титул 38 Свода законов США, 4212) и раздела 503 Закона 1973 года «О
реабилитационной помощи» (с дополнениями и изменениями), а также положений титула 41
Свода федеральных постановлений, частей 60-1, 60-60, 60-250 и 60-741. Положение о
позитивных действиях и нормативные документы, указанные в предшествующем предложении,
включаются в настоящий договор посредством ссылки.
12.2 Коммерческие продукты. Для Конечных пользователей в государственных учреждениях
США Программное обеспечение является «Коммерческим продуктом» (в значении,
присвоенном данному термину в нормативном документе 48 C.F.R., Раздел 2.101) и включает в
себя «Коммерческое компьютерное программное обеспечение» и «Документацию к
коммерческому компьютерному программному обеспечению» в значении, присвоенном данным
терминам в нормативном документе 48 C.F.R. §12.212 или 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 (в зависимости от
того, какой документ применим). В соответствии с положениями нормативных документов 48
C.F.R. §12.212 или 48 C.F.R, разделы 227.7202-1 по 227.7202-4 включительно (в зависимости от
того, какой документ применим), Коммерческое компьютерное программное обеспечение и
Документация к коммерческому компьютерному программному обеспечению предоставляются
государственным конечным пользователям в США по лицензии: (a) лишь как Коммерческие
продукты; и (b) лишь с тем объемом прав, который предоставлен всем иным конечным
пользователям на условиях, приведенных в настоящем договоре. Права на неопубликованные
продукты сохраняются на основании законодательства об авторских правах Соединенных
Штатов.
13. Выполнение требований лицензий.
Если Клиент является хозяйственным предприятием, компанией или организацией, он
соглашается с тем, что помимо проверок соблюдения условий лицензии, выполняемых
Программным обеспечением, Adobe или полномочные представители имеют право не чаще
одного раза в 12 (двенадцать) месяцев по предварительному уведомлению, направленному не
менее чем за 7 (семь) рабочих дней, проводить проверки учетных документов, систем и средств
Клиента для подтверждения того, что использование любого и всего Программного обеспечения
Adobe осуществляется в соответствии с действующей лицензией, полученной от компании
Adobe. Например, Adobe имеет право на доступ к учетным документам Клиента, необходимым
для определения использования серийных номеров для Программного обеспечения, а Клиент
обязан представить такие документы незамедлительно по запросу Adobe. Кроме того, Клиент
обязан в 30-дневный срок после получения запроса предоставить компании Adobe все
запрошенные ею учетные документы и сведения, подтверждающие, что использование любого
программного обеспечения Adobe соответствует действующим лицензиям Adobe.
Дополнительную информацию относительно использования серийных номеров см. на сайте

14. Подключение к Интернету и конфиденциальность.
14.1 Автоматическое подключение к Интернету. Программное обеспечение может без
уведомления выполнять автоматическое подключение Компьютера Клиента к Интернету и
передачу данных на веб-сайт компании Adobe или в домен Adobe с целью удостоверения
подлинности лицензии и предоставления Клиенту дополнительных сведений, функций и
возможностей. Если иное не указано в пунктах 14.2 - 14.7, то ко всем автоматическим
подключениям к Интернету, которые выполняет Программное обеспечение, применяются
следующие положения.
14.1.1 Во всех случаях, когда Программное обеспечение подключается к Интернету для связи с
сайтом Adobe, будь то автоматически или по прямой команде пользователя, применяется
«Политика по защите конфиденциальности информации». Политика по защите
конфиденциальности компании Adobe разрешает отслеживание посещений веб-сайтов и
содержит подробные сведения по теме отслеживания и использования файлов cookie, веб-
маяков и аналогичных средств.
14.1.2 При каждом соединении с Adobe, осуществляемом Программным обеспечением по
Интернету, Adobe получает определенную информацию о Клиенте, передаваемую Программным
обеспечением в Adobe в соответствии с Политикой Adobe по защите конфиденциальности
информации в сети Интернет, см. http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ru («Политика
конфиденциальности»).
14.1.3 Если Клиент использует Онлайн-услуги Adobe (в соответствии с определением,
приведенным ниже в пункте 16.4) или активирует и регистрирует Программное обеспечение,
дополнительная информация, такая как идентификатор Adobe ID, присвоенный Клиенту, имя
клиента и пароль, может передаваться на хранение в Adobe с соблюдением Политики
конфиденциальности и дополнительных условий пользования, связанных с такими Онлайн-
услугами Adobe (условия пользования сайтом Adobe.com и любые такие дополнительные
условия совместно именуются «Дополнительные условия пользования»).
14.1.4 Если это разрешено применимым законодательством или согласовано с Клиентом, Adobe
может: (a) направлять Клиенту операционные сообщения, помогающие использовать Онлайн-
услуги Adobe или осуществить активацию или регистрацию Программного обеспечения или
Онлайн-услуг Adobe, или (b) включать в состав продукта элементы маркетинга в целях
предоставления информации о Программном обеспечении и других продуктах и Услугах Adobe,
включая, помимо прочего, информацию о версии платформы, версии Программного
обеспечения, статусе лицензии и языке.
14.2 Обновление. Программное обеспечение может выполнять автоматическое подключение
Компьютера Клиента к Интернету без уведомления (периодически или регулярно): (a) в целях
проверки наличия Обновленных версий для загрузки и установки на Компьютер и (b) в целях
информирования Adobe о результатах попыток установки.
14.3 Активация. Для использования Программного обеспечения может потребоваться, чтобы
Клиент: (a) получил идентификатор Adobe ID, (b) выполнил активацию или повторную активацию
Программного обеспечения, (c) зарегистрировал Программное обеспечение или (d) удостоверил
подлинность своего Членства. Для выполнения этих требований Компьютер Клиента может без
уведомления подключаться к Интернету во время установки или запуска Программного
обеспечения и с регулярными интервалами после этого. После подключения Программное
обеспечение соберет и передаст в Adobe информацию, описанную на сайте
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ru («Условия активации»). Программное обеспечение или
Клиент также могут получать информацию от Adobe в отношении лицензии, подписки или
Членства Клиента. Adobe может использовать такую информацию для обнаружения или
предотвращения обмана или несанкционированного использования, не соответствующего
условиям действующей лицензии, подписки или Членства. Невыполнение требований об
активации или регистрации Программного обеспечения, удостоверении подлинности подписки
--- Page 375 ---
или Членства или выявление компанией Adobe факта обмана или несанкционированного
использования Программного обеспечения может привести к сокращению объема функций или
прекращению работы Программного обеспечения, либо к прекращению или приостановке
подписки или Членства.
14.4 Деактивация. Клиент может деактивировать и удалить Программное обеспечение со своего
Компьютера, чтобы установить и активировать это Программное обеспечение на другом
Компьютере в соответствии с условиями настоящего договора («Деактивация»), как более
подробно описано на сайте: http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ru. Для деактивации требуется
соединение с Интернетом.
14.5 Использование Онлайн-услуг. Программное обеспечение может без дополнительного
уведомления автоматически выполнять периодическое или регулярное подключение
Компьютера Клиента к Интернету в целях получения доступа к контенту и услугам,
предоставляемым компанией Adobe или третьими сторонами, как более подробно описано в
пункте 16.4 (Онлайн-услуги). Кроме того, Программное обеспечение может без уведомления
автоматически подключаться к Интернету в целях обновления загружаемых материалов с
помощью этих онлайн-услуг, чтобы обеспечить моментальную доступность этих услуг даже во
время автономной работы Клиента.
14.6 Цифровые сертификаты. Программное обеспечение использует цифровые сертификаты (как
описано в пункте 16.5), чтобы Клиент мог идентифицировать загружаемые файлы (например,
приложения и контент) и их издателей. Например, Adobe AIR использует цифровые сертификаты,
чтобы помочь Клиенту идентифицировать издателя приложений Adobe AIR. В семействе
продуктов Adobe Acrobat используются цифровые сертификаты для подписи и удостоверения
подписей в файлах переносимого формата для документов (PDF), а также для удостоверения
сертифицированных документов PDF. Во время удостоверения цифрового сертификата
компьютер Клиента может подключиться к Интернету.
14.7 Менеджер параметров настройки. В состав Программного обеспечения может входить Flash
Player. Использование Flash Player может привести к сохранению некоторых параметров
настройки пользователя на Компьютере Клиента в виде локальных совместно используемых
объектов. Эти настройки ассоциируются с экземпляром Flash Player, установленным на
Компьютере, что позволяет Клиенту настроить конфигурацию функций среды выполнения.
Менеджер параметров настройки Flash Player позволяет Клиенту изменять такие настройки,
включая ограничение на сохранение локальных совместно используемых объектов третьими
лицами или предоставление для контента третьих лиц права на доступ к микрофону и камере
компьютера. Более подробная информация о настройке параметров применяемой версии
программы Flash Player, включая инструкцию по отключению локальных совместно
используемых объектов в Менеджере параметров настройки Flash Player, опубликована на сайте
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_ru. Дополнительную информацию относительно
локальных совместно используемых объектов см. на сайте
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_ru.
15. Связь в одноранговых сетях.
Программное обеспечение может без дополнительного уведомления использовать
подключение Клиента к локальной сети с целью автоматического подключения к другому
программному обеспечению Adobe и при этом отправлять в локальную сеть сведения о
готовности к связи с другим программным обеспечением Adobe. Эти соединения могут
передавать IР-адрес подключения Клиента к локальной сети.
--- Page 376 ---
16. Особые положения и исключения.
В настоящем разделе приводятся особые положения и исключения, относящиеся к некоторым
продуктам и компонентам Программного обеспечения, а также ограниченные исключения из
приведенных выше условий и положений. Если какое-либо положение настоящего раздела
противоречит любому иному условию настоящего договора, положения настоящего раздела
заменяют собой такие условия.
16.1 Отсутствие ограничений прав. Постановления, действующие на территории Европейской
экономической зоны. Обязательное уведомление для Австралии.
16.1.1 Настоящий договор не ограничивает законодательно установленные права любой
стороны, включая потребителей. Например, в отношении потребителей в Новой Зеландии,
приобретающих Программное обеспечение для личного пользования либо для использования в
домашних условиях или в домашнем хозяйстве (а не для осуществления предпринимательской
деятельности), к настоящему договору применяется Закон о гарантиях для потребителей.
16.1.2 Если Программное обеспечение приобретено на территории Европейской экономической
зоны (ЕЭЗ) Клиентом, обычно проживающим в ЕЭЗ, который использует Программное
обеспечение в личных целях, а не для осуществления предпринимательской деятельности, то
Раздел 6 (Ограниченная гарантия) не распространяется на приобретение и использование
Программного обеспечения Клиентом. Вместо этого компания Adobe гарантирует, что
Программное обеспечение будет обеспечивать функциональные возможности, приведенные в
Документации («согласованные функциональные возможности»), в течение 2 лет с момента его
приобретения при условии, что Программное обеспечение используется на Совместимом
Компьютере. Незначительное отклонение от согласованных функциональных возможностей не
служит основанием для возникновения каких-либо прав на гарантию. НАСТОЯЩАЯ ГАРАНТИЯ
НЕ ПРИМЕНЯЕТСЯ К ПРОГРАММНОМУ ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЮ, ИСПОЛЬЗУЕМОМУ В ВИДЕ
ПРЕДВАРИТЕЛЬНОЙ, ОПЫТНОЙ, НАЧАЛЬНОЙ И ПРОБНОЙ КОПИИ, ИЛИ К ШРИФТОВОМУ
ПРОГРАММНОМУ ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЮ, А ТАКЖЕ К ДЕФЕКТАМ ПРОГРАММНОГО ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЯ,
ВОЗНИКШИМ В РЕЗУЛЬТАТЕ ЕГО МОДИФИКАЦИИ КЛИЕНТОМ. Для предъявления гарантийной
рекламации Клиент должен уведомить Отдел обслуживания клиентов компании Adobe в течение
этого 2-летнего периода, представив доказательство покупки Программного обеспечения.
Компания Adobe проведет проверку, чтобы выявить наличие дефекта в Программном
обеспечении, или сообщит о том, что ошибка возникла в результате неправильной установки
Программного обеспечения Клиентом (в этом случае компания Adobe окажет ему помощь). При
наличии дефекта в Программном обеспечении Клиент имеет право потребовать от компании
Adobe возместить стоимость Программного обеспечения либо предоставить его исправленную
или заменяющую копию. Вместе с запросами необходимо представить доказательство покупки.
После подтверждения права Клиента на гарантию компания Adobe удовлетворит запрос на
предоставление ему исправленной или заменяющей копии Программного обеспечения, но если
предоставление такой копии нецелесообразно, то Adobe возместит стоимость Программного
обеспечения. Для получения помощи по гарантии обратитесь в Отдел обслуживания клиентов
компании Adobe.
Обратите внимание, что положения пункта 8 (Ограничение ответственности) распространяются
на любые требования Клиента о возмещении убытков, связанных с использованием
Программного обеспечения. Однако компания Adobe также несет ответственность за любые
прямые убытки, возникающие в случае нарушения ею настоящего договора, если такие убытки в
разумной степени можно было предвидеть. Клиенту рекомендуется принять все разумные меры
в целях предотвращения или уменьшения ущерба, в частности, путем создания резервных копий
Программного обеспечения и компьютерных данных.
--- Page 377 ---
Настоящий договор и, в частности, данный пункт 16.1.2, предназначен для описания прав Клиента
(включая законодательно установленные права) в случае возникновения проблем при
использовании Программного обеспечения. Если объем законодательно установленных прав
Клиента превышает объем прав, описанных здесь, то применяются законодательно
установленные права.
16.1.3 Никакие положения настоящего договора (включая пункт 4.4) не ограничивают
безотзывное право на декомпиляцию Программного обеспечения, которое может быть
предоставлено Клиенту применимым законодательством. Например, при нахождении на
территории Европейского Союза (ЕС), Клиент при определенных условиях, предусмотренных
применимым законодательством, может иметь право на декомпиляцию Программного
обеспечения, если это необходимо в целях достижения совместимости Программного
обеспечения с другим программным обеспечением, если Клиент письменно запросил Adobe о
представлении информации, необходимой для обеспечения такой совместимости Программного
обеспечения, а компания Adobe не предоставила такую информацию. Кроме того, декомпиляция
может быть произведена исключительно Клиентом или лицом, имеющим право на
использование копии Программного обеспечения от имени Клиента. Компания Adobe имеет
право на предъявление обоснованных условий перед предоставлением упомянутой выше
информации. Любая информация, предоставленная компанией Adobe или полученная Клиентом
на условиях настоящего договора, может использоваться Клиентом только в целях, описанных в
настоящем договоре, и не может передаваться третьим лицам или использоваться в целях
создания программного обеспечения, в значительной степени аналогичного Программному
обеспечению, или в рамках любых других действий, нарушающих авторское право компании
Adobe или ее лицензиатов.
16.1.4 Если Клиент приобретает Программное обеспечение в Австралии, то будет действовать
следующее положение, невзирая на любые противоречащие этому условия настоящего
Договора.
УВЕДОМЛЕНИЕ ДЛЯ ПОТРЕБИТЕЛЕЙ В АВСТРАЛИИ:
Наши товары поставляются с гарантиями, которые не могут быть исключены в соответствии с
австралийским законом о защите потребителей. Вы имеете право на замену или возмещение в
случае значительного отказа и на компенсацию в случае любых других убытков или потерь,
которые в разумной степени можно было бы предвидеть. Вы также можете затребовать ремонт
или замену товаров в случае их неприемлемого качества или в случае неисправности, не
представляющей собой значительный отказ. Наши программные продукты также поставляются с
ограниченной гарантией на 90 дней, предоставляемой компанией Adobe Systems Software Ireland
Limited, юридический адрес: 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland (Ирландия),

Льготы, предусмотренные настоящей гарантией, предоставляются в дополнение к любым другим
правам и средствам защиты прав, которыми вы можете располагать в соответствии с законом.
16.2 Дополнительные условия в отношении Предварительных версий программного
обеспечения. Положения настоящего пункта применяются в отношении Программного
обеспечения, предварительно выпущенного до его коммерческого распространения или
относящегося к категории «бета» (далее именуется «Предварительная версия программного
обеспечения»). Предварительная версия программного обеспечения представляет собой
неокончательную версию, не является конечным продуктом Adobe и может содержать дефекты,
ошибки и другие недостатки, которые могут привести к сбоям в системе и утрате данных.
Компания Adobe может никогда не перейти к коммерческому выпуску Программного
--- Page 378 ---
обеспечения, выпущенного в предварительной версии. Если Предварительная версия
программного обеспечения получена Клиентом по отдельному письменному соглашению,
например, по Лицензионному соглашению Adobe Systems Incorporated на Предварительные
версии программного обеспечения, то использование Программного обеспечения Клиентом
также будет регулироваться этим соглашением. Клиент обязан незамедлительно вернуть или
уничтожить все копии Предварительной версии программного обеспечения по требованию
компании Adobe либо после коммерческого выпуска этого Программного обеспечения

Программное обеспечение, получил идентификатор Adobe ID, согласился на соблюдение
Дополнительных условий пользования или заплатил дополнительный сбор за право доступа к
таким Онлайн-услугам Adobe. Онлайн-услуги компании Adobe могут предоставляться не на всех
языках или не во всех странах, и компания Adobe может в любое время и по любой причине
изменить условия их использования и запретить доступ к любым своим Онлайн-услугам. Кроме
того, компания Adobe оставляет за собой право взимать плату за доступ или использование
своих Онлайн-услуг, которые ранее предлагались бесплатно. В пункте 14 приводится важная
информация в отношении связи с Интернетом и защиты конфиденциальности данных Клиента.
Как описано в пункте 14, когда Программное обеспечение получает доступ к Онлайн-услугам
Adobe, их использование регулируется Политикой конфиденциальности Adobe
(http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ru), Условиями использования сайта Adobe.com
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_ru), а также Дополнительными условиями пользования, которые
могут быть предъявлены Клиенту в это время.
16.4.2 Услуги, предоставляемые Третьими лицами. Программное обеспечение может обеспечить
доступ Клиента к сайтам третьих лиц, которые предлагают товары, информацию, программное
обеспечение и услуги («Онлайн-услуги третьих лиц»). К таким Онлайн-услугам третьих лиц
относятся, например, услуги онлайновой фотогалереи Kodak EasyShare Gallery. Доступ к Онлайн-
услугам третьих лиц и их использование регулируется в соответствии с условиями, положениями,
отказами от гарантий и уведомлениями, находящимися на таком сайте или иным образом
связанными с этими Онлайн-услугами третьих лиц. Adobe не контролирует Онлайн-услуги
третьих лиц, не рекомендует их и не принимает на себя ответственность за их использование.
Любые деловые отношения Клиента с любым третьим лицом, связанные с Онлайн-услугами
--- Page 379 ---
третьих лиц, включая политику конфиденциальности такого третьего лица, использование
личной информации, поставку и оплату товаров и услуг, а также все условия, положения,
гарантии и заверения, связанные с такими отношениями, осуществляются исключительно между
Клиентом и этим третьим лицом. Онлайн-услуги третьих лиц могут предоставляться не на всех
языках или не во всех странах. Кроме того, компания Adobe может в любое время и по любой
причине изменить условия их использования и запретить доступ к любым Онлайн-услугам
третьих лиц.

КЛИЕНТ ИСПОЛЬЗУЕТ ОНЛАЙНОВЫЕ УСЛУГИ КОМПАНИИ ADOBE И ОНЛАЙНОВЫЕ УСЛУГИ
ТРЕТЬИХ ЛИЦ НА СВОЙ СОБСТВЕННЫЙ РИСК С УЧЕТОМ ОГРАНИЧЕНИЙ ГАРАНТИИ И
ОТВЕТСТВЕННОСТИ, ПРИВЕДЕННЫХ В РАЗДЕЛАХ 7 И 8.
16.5 Цифровые сертификаты.
16.5.1 Использование. Цифровые сертификаты выдаются сторонними центрами сертификации,
включая поставщиков услуг по сертификации документов Adobe (Adobe Certified Document
Services (CDS)), список которых опубликован на сайте http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_ru, и
поставщиков, входящих в список утвержденных доверенных лиц (Adobe Approved Trust List
(AATL)), опубликованный на сайте http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_ru (совместно именуются
«Центры сертификации»), или же могут быть подписаны самостоятельно.
16.5.2 Условия и положения. Клиент вместе с Центром сертификации несет ответственность за
покупку, использование цифровых сертификатов и доверие к ним. Прежде чем доверять
сертифицированному документу, цифровой подписи или услугам Центра сертификации, Клиент
должен изучить соответствующие условия и положения, в соответствии с которыми данный
Центр сертификации предоставляет услуги, включая, например, любые соглашения с
подписчиками и сторонами-получателями сертифицированных документов, положения о
политике и практике в области сертификации документов. См. ссылки на сайте
http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds_ru для получения более подробной информации о
поставщиках Adobe CDS и http://www.adobe.com/go/aatl_ru о поставщиках AATL.
16.5.3 Признание. Клиент понимает, что: (a) Программное обеспечение из-за конфигурации или
внешнего воздействия может отображать цифровую подпись как действительную, хотя на самом
деле цифровой сертификат мог быть просрочен или отозван до момента проверки подписи;
(b) безопасность и целостность цифрового сертификата может подвергаться риску вследствие
действия или упущения лица, подписавшего документ, соответствующего Центра сертификации
или любого иного третьего лица; и (c) сертификат может быть подписан самостоятельно, а не
выдан Центром сертификации. КЛИЕНТ НЕСЕТ ВСЮ ОТВЕТСТВЕННОСТЬ ЗА РЕШЕНИЕ О ТОМ,
СЛЕДУЕТ ЛИ ДОВЕРЯТЬ СЕРТИФИКАТУ. ЕСЛИ ЦЕНТР СЕРТИФИКАЦИИ НЕ ПРЕДОСТАВИТ
ОТДЕЛЬНУЮ ПИСЬМЕННУЮ ГАРАНТИЮ, КЛИЕНТ ИСПОЛЬЗУЕТ ЦИФРОВЫЕ СЕРТИФИКАТЫ НА
СВОЙ СОБСТВЕННЫЙ РИСК.
16.5.4 Третьи лица — выгодоприобретатели. Клиент соглашается с тем, что любой Центр
сертификации, которому он доверяет, является третьим лицом-выгодоприобретателем по
настоящему договору и будет иметь право на принудительное осуществление данного договора
от своего имени, как если бы он являлся компанией Adobe.
16.5.5 Ограждение от ответственности и возмещение ущерба. Клиент соглашается оградить от
ответственности компанию Adobe и любой соответствующий Центр сертификации (кроме
случаев, явно оговоренных условиями и положениями) в связи с любыми материальными
обязательствами, убытками, исками, требованиями возмещения или претензиями (включая все
разумные расходы, издержки и гонорары юристов), возникающими в результате использования
услуг данного центра или в связи с ними, включая, помимо прочего: (a) доверие к истекшему или
отозванному сертификату; (b) ненадлежащую верификацию сертификата; (c) использование
сертификата в порядке, отличном от разрешенного соответствующими условиями и

положениями, настоящим договором или применимым законодательством; (d) непринятие в
сложившихся обстоятельствах разумного решения в отношении доверия к услугам провайдера

16.6.2 Если Разрешенное число Компьютеров не превышает пяти (5), допускается загрузка
шрифтового программного обеспечения в память (на жесткий диск или в RAM) одного
выходного устройства, подключенного, по меньшей мере, к одному из таких Компьютеров, для
того, чтобы шрифтовое программное обеспечение оставалось резидентным в этом выходном
устройстве, а если Разрешенное число компьютеров больше пяти, то разрешается загрузка этого
программного обеспечения в память нескольких выходных устройств (из расчета одно
устройство на каждые пять Компьютеров в пределах их Разрешенного числа).
16.6.3 Клиент может создать копию шрифтов, которые он использовал в конкретном файле, для
передачи коммерческому полиграфическому предприятию или другому сервисному бюро, и
такое сервисное бюро может использовать шрифты для обработки файла при условии, что это
бюро имеет действительную лицензию на право использовать данное шрифтовое программное
обеспечение.
16.6.4 Копии шрифтового программного обеспечения разрешается внедрять в электронные
документы для целей распечатки, просмотра и редактирования этих документов. Настоящая
лицензия не предусматривает и не создает никаких других прав на внедрение шрифтов в файлы.
16.6.5 В виде исключения из приведенных выше положений, шрифты, перечень которых
приведен по адресу http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_ru, включены в состав
Программного обеспечения исключительно в целях функционирования пользовательского
интерфейса и не подлежат включению в какие-либо Выходные файлы. Шрифты, входящие в этот
перечень, не лицензируются в соответствии с настоящим пунктом 16.6. Клиент соглашается не
копировать перечисленные шрифты, не перемещать, не активировать и не использовать их
(например, с помощью какого-либо инструмента для управления шрифтами) в любых
приложениях, программах или файлах, кроме Программного обеспечения.
16.7 After Effects Render Engine. В случае если Программное обеспечение включает в себя полную
версию программы Adobe After Effects, Клиент вправе установить на Компьютеры в пределах
своей Внутренней сети, в которой имеется хотя бы один Компьютер с полной версией
программы Adobe After Effects, неограниченное число Render Engines. Термином «Render Engine»
обозначается устанавливаемая часть Программного обеспечения, которая позволяет
демонстрировать проекты After Effects, но не может использоваться для создания или изменения
проектов и не содержит полного пользовательского интерфейса After Effects.
16.8 Функции программ Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro и Adobe Acrobat Suite. Если Программное

косвенно, каким бы то ни было образом, включая, помимо прочего, посредством сети или
Интернета, Расширенный документ одному или нескольким получателям.
--- Page 381 ---
16.8.1.2 «Расширенный документ» означает файл в формате PDF, обработанный Программным
обеспечением для того, чтобы обеспечить возможность локального сохранения документов с

документа или любого печатного воспроизведения такого Расширенного документа,
содержащего заполненные поля формы, либо (b) Доставить такой Расширенный документ не
более чем пятистам (500) отдельным получателям без ограничения числа раз, когда Клиент
вправе извлекать информацию из такого Расширенного документа, возвращенного Клиенту
после заполнения такими получателями. Независимо от любых противоречащих этому
положений, получение дополнительных лицензий на использование Acrobat Standard, Acrobat
Pro или Adobe Acrobat Suite не является основанием для расширения вышеупомянутых пределов
(то есть, указанные выше пределы представляют собой общее суммарное количество
ограничений, независимо от того, сколько дополнительных лицензий на использование Acrobat
Standard, Acrobat Pro или Adobe Acrobat Suite получено).
16.9 Проекторы и среды выполнения Flash Player. Полный объем прав Клиента на использование
программы Flash player, проектора, автономного проигрывателя, плагина, среды выполнения или

подключаться к программному обеспечению Contribute Publishing Services в соответствии с
лицензионным соглашением с конечным пользователем по программному обеспечению
Contribute Publishing Services.
16.11 Adobe Presenter. Если в состав Программного обеспечения входит Adobe Presenter, то при
установке или использовании Клиентом прикладной программы Adobe Connect Add-in
совместно с использованием Программного обеспечения Клиент соглашается с тем, что

или сетевые планшеты. Кроме того, часть Программного обеспечения (а именно, среда
выполнения Adobe Presenter Run-Time), которая внедрена в презентацию, информацию или
содержимое, созданные и разработанные с использованием Программного обеспечения, может
быть использована только вместе с такой презентацией, информацией или информационным
обеспечением, которые она сопровождает. Клиент не вправе использовать и должен запретить
всем получателям лицензии на такую презентацию, информацию или контент использовать иной
Adobe Presenter Run-Time, чем тот, который внедрен в такие презентацию, информацию или

--- Page 382 ---
информацию или контент запрещается совершать следующие действия: изменять,
переконструировать и деассемблировать Adobe Presenter Run-Time.

Digital Publishing Plug-in for InDesign. Если Программное обеспечение содержит инструмент DPS
Desktop Tool (или его любой компонент), то, кроме как в случаях, оговоренных в настоящем
пункте 16 или в Дополнительных условиях пользования, Клиент может установить и
использовать инструменты DPS Desktop Tools исключительно в целях: (a) создания или
изготовления контента, предназначенного для показа с помощью просмотрового средства
Content Viewer («Выходной файл»), (b) оценки и тестирования Выходного файла и (c) где это
возможно, для доступа к услугам Adobe Digital Publishing Suite и использования этих услуг в

suscripción en el mismo Equipo durante el Período de vigencia de la licencia. El Cliente acepta que
Adobe puede cambiar el tipo de Software (como componentes específicos, versiones, plataformas,
idiomas, etc.) incluido en la Edición de suscripción en cualquier momento y no será responsable ante el
Cliente por tal cambio. El acceso continuo a una Edición de suscripción requiere: (a) una conexión a
Internet recurrente para activar, renovar y validar la licencia, (b) recibo de Adobe o de su distribuidor
autorizado de los pagos de suscripción recurrente, y (c) aceptación por parte del Cliente de los términos
de suscripción y otros términos y condiciones adicionales disponibles en
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_es o en el momento de la compra. Si Adobe no recibe el
pago de suscripción recurrente o no puede validar la licencia de forma periódica, entonces puede que el
Software quede inactivo sin aviso adicional hasta que Adobe reciba el pago o valide la licencia.
2.1.3 Uso en equipos portátiles o personales. Sujeto a las restricciones establecidas en la siguiente
Sección 2.1.4, el usuario principal del Equipo en el que el Software está instalado según la
Sección 2.1 (“Usuario principal”) puede instalar una segunda copia del Software para su uso
exclusivo en un Equipo portátil o en un Equipo ubicado en su casa, siempre y cuando el Software del
portátil o del equipo doméstico no se utilice al mismo tiempo que el Software del Equipo principal.
2.1.4 Restricciones de uso secundario por licenciatarios múltiples. Si el Software se adquirió bajo un
contrato o programa de Adobe de licencias múltiples (como Adobe Volume Licensing) por cualquier
licenciatario que no sea un licenciatario múltiple para fines educativos, la segunda copia del Software
realizada de acuerdo con la Sección 2.1.3 deberá limitarse sólo al uso y negocio de ese licenciatario
múltiple.
2.1.5 Doble plataforma de arranque. El Software se cede bajo licencia para su uso en una plataforma de
sistema operativo específica. El Cliente debe adquirir una licencia independiente si desea utilizar el
Software en otra plataforma de sistema operativo diferente. Por ejemplo, si el Cliente desea instalar el
Software en plataformas del sistema operativo Mac OS y Windows en un dispositivo que funciona en
ambas plataformas (es decir, un equipo de arranque doble), el Cliente debe obtener dos licencias
diferentes para el Software. Esto es válido incluso si al Cliente se le entregan en el mismo soporte dos
versiones del Software, cada una de ellas para una plataforma de sistema operativo diferente.
2.1.6 Distribución desde un Servidor. Como se indica en la Documentación, el Cliente puede copiar una
imagen del Software en servidores de archivos informáticos dentro de su Red interna (“Servidor”) con la
finalidad de descargar e instalar el Software en Equipos dentro de la misma Red interna para utilizarlo
del modo permitido según se describe en la Sección 2.
2.1.7 Uso en un servidor.
2.1.7.1 Como se indica en un documento independiente de compra o en la Documentación y según las
restricciones de licencia estipuladas en este Contrato, el Cliente puede instalar el Software en un
Servidor sólo con la finalidad de permitir que un individuo desde un Equipo de la misma Red interna
(“Usuario de red”) pueda acceder y usar el Software. El Usuario de red que ha accedido a dicho Software
en el Servidor se denomina “Usuario de software de servidor”. El número total de Usuarios de software
de servidor (no el número simultáneo de usuarios) no puede superar el Número permitido. Como
ejemplo, si un Cliente ha adquirido 10 licencias de Software (el Número permitido es 10) y elige instalar
el Software en un Servidor, entonces el Cliente sólo podrá permitir que hasta 10 Usuarios de software
de servidor accedan al Software (aunque el Cliente pueda tener mas de 10 Usuarios de red o menos
de 10 usuarios concurrentes del Software).
--- Page 387 ---
2.1.7.2 Como aclaración y sin limitación, lo anterior no permite al Cliente instalar o acceder (ya sea
directamente o mediante comandos, datos o instrucciones) al Software: (a) desde o a un Equipo que no
pertenezca a la Red interna del Cliente, (b) para permitir servicios primarios (hosted services) de
Internet o Web, (c) por cualquier usuario que no tenga licencia para utilizar el Software bajo una licencia
válida de Adobe, (d) como parte de un sistema, flujo de trabajo o servicio, accesible para más del
Número permitido de usuarios, o (e) para operaciones no iniciadas por un usuario particular (por
ejemplo, procesamiento de servidores automatizados).

la Afiliación es actual y está activa (“Período de duración de la afiliación”) y (c) de forma coherente con
los términos de este Contrato y la Documentación aplicable. Tras la caducidad o terminación del
Período de duración de la afiliación, (x) puede que todo o parte del Software deje de funcionar sin
previo aviso e (y) el Cliente no podrá utilizar el Software a menos que haya renovado la afiliación. Todos
los términos relacionados con el Software específico como se indica en este Contrato permanecerán
efectivos y seguirán aplicándose al Cliente y a su uso del Software.
2.2.3 Restricciones. El Cliente acepta los siguientes términos y restricciones adicionales relacionados con
la Afiliación. (a) Adobe puede cambiar el tipo de Software (como componentes específicos, versiones,

diseñar, desarrollar y probar sitios web y aplicaciones desarrolladas usando programas de software de
Adobe siempre y cuando el Cliente esté autorizado a copiar y distribuir el Código muestra de la
aplicación (modificado o no modificado) si se cumplen todas estas condiciones: (a) El Cliente distribuye
únicamente las versiones de código del objeto compilado del Código muestra de la aplicación con su
aplicación; (b) el Cliente no incluye el Código muestra de la aplicación en ningún producto o aplicación
diseñada para el desarrollo de páginas web; y (c) el Cliente no usa el nombre, logotipos, iconos o

2.5 Lenguajes de programación. El Software puede incluir partes de los componentes ExtendScript SDK
y Pixel Bender SDK. Sujeto a las restricciones contenidas en esta Sección 2, Adobe otorga al Cliente una
licencia no exclusiva, no transferible y gratuita para utilizar estos elementos en ExtendScript SDK y Pixel
Bender SDK sólo con fines de desarrollo interno de programas diseñados para funcionar con productos
Adobe. Salvo lo permitido en esta Sección 2.5, no se podrá modificar o distribuir ninguna parte de
ExtendScript SDK o Pixel Bender SDK. El Cliente acepta indemnizar, mantener indemne y defender a
Adobe de cualquier pérdida, daño, reclamación o demanda, incluidos los honorarios de abogados que
pudieran derivarse de tal distribución.
2.6 Copias de la documentación. El Cliente puede realizar copias de la Documentación para su propio

Adobe Systems Incorporated y sus proveedores. La estructura, organización y código fuente del
Software son secretos comerciales e información confidencial valiosa de Adobe Systems Incorporated y
sus proveedores. El Software está protegido por la ley, incluyendo, entre otros, las leyes de derechos de

términos de uso de Adobe.com y los términos aplicables, los “Términos de uso adicionales”).
14.1.4 Tal y como se establece en la ley aplicable o ha aceptado el Cliente, Adobe puede (a) enviar al
Cliente mensajes transaccionales para facilitar el Servicio en línea de Adobe o la activación o registro
del Software o el Servicio en línea de Adobe o (b) utilizar técnicas de marketing sobre un producto para
ofrecer información sobre el Software y otros productos y servicios de Adobe utilizando información
que incluye, pero sin limitarse a, la versión de la plataforma, versión del Software, estado de la licencia e
idioma.
14.2 Actualización. El Software puede hacer que el Equipo del Cliente, sin ningún aviso adicional, se
conecte automáticamente a Internet (de manera intermitente o regular) para (a) buscar las
actualizaciones disponibles para su descarga e instalación en el Equipo y (b) para informar a Adobe de
los resultados de sus intentos de instalación.
14.3 Activación. El Software puede requerir que el Cliente (a) obtenga un ID de Adobe, (b) active o
reactive el Software, (c) registre el software o (d) valide la Afiliación. Este requisito puede hacer que el
Equipo del Cliente se conecte a Internet sin aviso al instalar, iniciar o de forma regular. Una vez
conectado, el Software recopilará y transmitirá información a Adobe como se describe en
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_es (“Términos de activación”). El Software o el Cliente pueden
--- Page 394 ---
recibir también información de Adobe relacionada con la licencia, la suscripción o la afiliación del
Cliente. Adobe puede utilizar dicha información para detectar o evitar el uso fraudulento o no
autorizado según una licencia, suscripción o afiliación válidas. Un error al activar o registrar el Software,
validar la suscripción o Afiliación, o una determinación por parte de Adobe de uso fraudulento o no
autorizado del Software puede provocar una funcionalidad reducida o inoperatividad del Software, o la
terminación o suspensión de la suscripción o Afiliación.
14.4 Desactivación. El Cliente puede desactivar e instalar el Software de su Equipo para instalar y activar
el Software en otro Equipo según este contrato (“Desactivación”) y como se describe con más detalle en
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_es. La desactivación requiere conexión a Internet.
14.5 Uso de los Servicios en línea. El Software puede hacer que el Equipo del Cliente, sin ningún aviso
adicional y de forma intermitente o regular, se conecte automáticamente a Internet para permitir al
Cliente acceder a contenido y servicios que Adobe u otros terceros le proporcionan como se describe
detalladamente en la Sección 16.4 (Servicios en línea). Además, el Software puede, sin ningún aviso
adicional, conectarse automáticamente a Internet para actualizar materiales descargables de estos
servicios en línea y proporcionar disponibilidad inmediata incluso cuando el Cliente no está conectado.
14.6 Certificados digitales. El Software utiliza certificados digitales (como se describe en la Sección 16.5)
para ayudar al Cliente a identificar los archivos descargados (por ejemplo, aplicaciones y contenido) y a
los editores de esos archivos. Por ejemplo, Adobe AIR utiliza certificados digitales para ayudar al Cliente
a identificar al editor de las aplicaciones Adobe AIR. La familia de productos de Adobe Acrobat utiliza
certificados digitales para firmar y validar las firmas de los documentos en formato portátil (“PDF”), así
como para validar los documentos PDF certificados. El Equipo del Cliente puede conectarse a Internet
en el momento de la validación de un certificado digital.
14.7 Administrador de configuración. El Software puede incluir Flash Player. Flash Player puede guardar
algunas configuraciones de usuario almacenándolas como objetos locales compartidos en el Equipo del
Cliente. Están asociadas a la instancia de Flash Player en el Equipo, lo que le permite que el Cliente
personalice características de tiempo de ejecución. El Administrador de configuración de Flash Player
permite al Cliente modificar esas configuraciones, incluida la capacidad de limitar el derecho de que
terceros almacenen objetos locales compartidos o conceder al contenido de terceros el derecho a
acceder al micrófono y la cámara de su equipo. Hay más información acerca de la definición de las
configuraciones en su versión de Flash Player, incluyendo información sobre cómo desactivar objetos
locales compartidos con el Administrador de configuración de Flash Player disponible en
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_es. Hay más información acerca de los objetos locales
compartidos disponible en http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_es.
15. Comunicaciones de punto a punto.
El Software puede utilizar la conexión del Cliente a una red de área local, sin ningún aviso adicional,
para conectarse automáticamente con otro software de Adobe y, al hacerlo, puede indicar en la red de
área local que se encuentra disponible para la comunicación con otro software de Adobe. Estas
conexiones pueden transmitir la Dirección IP de la conexión del Cliente a la red de área local.
16. Disposiciones y excepciones específicas.
Esta sección expone las disposiciones específicas relacionadas con ciertos productos y componentes del
Software, así como las excepciones limitadas a las condiciones arriba indicadas. En la medida en que
cualquier disposición recogida en esta sección esté en conflicto con cualquier otra condición de este
contrato, los términos establecidos en esta sección prevalecerán sobre tal otra condición.
16.1 Sin perjuicios; Disposiciones del Espacio Económico Europeo; Aviso obligatorio en Australia.
--- Page 395 ---
16.1.1 Este contrato no perjudicará a los derechos legales de cualquier parte, incluyendo los de los
consumidores. Por ejemplo, para los consumidores en Nueva Zelanda que obtengan el Software para
uso personal, doméstico o casero (sin propósitos comerciales), esta licencia está sujeta a la Ley de
Garantías del Consumidor.
16.1.2 Si el Cliente ha obtenido el Software en el Espacio Económico Europeo (EEE), el Cliente reside
normalmente en el EEE y es un consumidor (esto es, usa el Software para uso personal), la Sección 6
(Garantía limitada) no se aplicará a la compra y uso del Software por parte del Cliente. En su lugar,
Adobe garantiza durante un período de 2 años a partir de la fecha de compra que el Software
proporciona las funcionalidades establecidas en el manual del usuario aplicable (las “funcionalidades
convenidas”) cuando se utilice con la configuración del equipo recomendada. No se establecerá
derecho de garantía para el caso de variaciones no sustanciales según lo indicado en la Documentación.
ESTA GARANTÍA NO SE APLICARÁ AL SOFTWARE QUE USE EL CLIENTE EN PRELANZAMIENTOS,
PRUEBAS, PRODUCTOS BÁSICOS (STARTER), MUESTRAS DE PRODUCTOS O PARA EL SOFTWARE DE
FUENTE O EN LA MEDIDA EN QUE FALLE EL SOFTWARE POR HABER SIDO MODIFICADO POR EL
CLIENTE. Para efectuar cualquier reclamación de garantía, el Cliente debe avisar al Departamento de
atención al cliente de Adobe durante este período de 2 años y proporcionar detalles del comprobante
de compra del Software. Adobe comprobará con el Cliente si existe un defecto en el Software o le
advertirá de que el error se debe a una instalación incorrecta del Software (en ese caso, Adobe no
proporcionará asistencia al Cliente). Si existe un defecto en el Software, el Cliente puede solicitar que
Adobe le reembolse su precio o le proporcione una copia reparada o de sustitución del Software. Las
solicitudes deben ir acompañadas del comprobante de compra. En caso de que se prueben los detalles
de la garantía del Cliente, Adobe proporcionará al Cliente el Software reparado o de sustitución
solicitado, a menos que no sea razonable para Adobe, en cuyo caso Adobe le reembolsará al Cliente su
precio. Para obtener asistencia sobre la garantía, póngase en contacto con el Departamento de atención
al cliente de Adobe.
Tenga en cuenta que las disposiciones de la Sección 8 (Limitación de la responsabilidad) seguirán
aplicándose a todas las reclamaciones por daños que el Cliente realice con respecto a su uso del
Software. Sin embargo, Adobe será responsable de las pérdidas directas que se puedan predecir
razonablemente en caso de que Adobe incumpla este contrato. Es aconsejable que el Cliente tome
todas las medidas razonables para evitar y reducir los daños; en especial, realizar copias de seguridad
del Software y de sus datos informáticos.
Este contrato y, en particular, esta Sección 16.1.2, tiene la finalidad de exponer los derechos del Cliente
(incluidos sus derechos legales) en caso de que surjan problemas relacionados con el uso del Software.
Si los derechos legales del Cliente son más amplios que esta descripción, se aplicarán sus derechos
legales.
16.1.3 Nada incluido en este contrato (incluida la Sección 4.4) limitará ningún derecho irrenunciable a
descompilar el Software que le otorgue al Cliente la legislación aplicable. Por ejemplo, si el Cliente se
encuentra en la Unión Europea (UE), es posible que el Cliente tenga derecho en determinadas
condiciones especificadas en la legislación pertinente a descompilar el Software, si necesita hacerlo para
lograr la interoperabilidad del Software con otro programa de software y si el Cliente hubiera solicitado
primero a Adobe que le proporcionara la información necesaria para conseguir esa operatividad y
Adobe no le hubiera facilitado dicha información. Además, dicha descompilación sólo podrá realizarla
el Cliente o algún otro usuario con derecho a utilizar una copia del Software en nombre del Cliente.
Adobe se reserva el derecho de establecer condiciones razonables antes de facilitar la referida
información. Cualquier información facilitada por Adobe u obtenida por el Cliente, según se establece
en este contrato, sólo podrá ser usada por el Cliente para la finalidad descrita aquí y no podrá ser
revelada a terceros ni usada para crear ningún software que sea sustancialmente similar a la expresión
del Software o utilizada para cualquier acción que infrinja los derechos de autor de Adobe o sus
otorgantes de licencia.
16.1.4 Si el Cliente obtiene el Software en Australia, se aplicará la siguiente disposición, sin perjuicio de
nada establecido en este Contrato:
--- Page 396 ---

16.2 Términos adicionales de Software de prelanzamiento. Si el Software es una versión de
prelanzamiento o Software versión beta (“Software de prelanzamiento”), será aplicable esta sección. El
Software de prelanzamiento no representa un producto final de Adobe y puede contener virus, errores
y otros problemas que podrían causar fallos en el sistema o de otro tipo, así como la pérdida de datos.
Es posible que Adobe nunca lance comercialmente el Software de prelanzamiento. Si el Cliente ha
recibido el Software de prelanzamiento de conformidad con un contrato escrito por separado, como el
contrato para productos de prelanzamiento de Adobe Systems Incorporated para el Software de
prelanzamiento, (Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release Software), el uso que
haga del Software el Cliente estará regulado igualmente por dicho contrato. El Cliente debe
comprometerse a devolver o destruir todas las copias del Software de prelanzamiento de forma
inmediata si así lo solicita Adobe o cuando Adobe comercialice dicho Software. EL CLIENTE UTILIZA EL
SOFTWARE DE PRELANZAMIENTO BAJO SU PROPIO RIESGO. CONSULTE LAS SECCIONES 6 Y 8 PARA
LA GARANTÍA LIMITADA Y LAS LIMITACIONES DE RESPONSABILIDAD QUE RIGEN EL SOFTWARE DE
PRELANZAMIENTO.
16.3 Software educativo. Si el Software es un Software educativo (Software fabricado y distribuido para
su uso por Usuarios finales de la línea educativa), el Cliente sólo estará autorizado a utilizar dicho
programa si cumple las condiciones de Usuario final de la línea educativa dentro de su jurisdicción.
Visite http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_es para obtener información sobre la idoneidad.
Visite http://www.adobe.com/go/store_es y busque el enlace para la compra de productos Adobe en
todo el mundo para buscar un Distribuidor de educación autorizado.

servicios albergados en sitios web mantenidos por Adobe o sus filiales (“Servicios en línea de Adobe”).
Entre los ejemplos de estos Servicios en línea de Adobe se incluyen entre otros: Adobe BrowserLab,

de bienvenida de productos. En algunos casos un Servicio en línea de Adobe puede aparecer como una
función o una extensión dentro del Software incluso si se aloja en un sitio web. El acceso a un Servicio
en línea de Adobe puede requerir que el Cliente active el Software, obtenga un ID de Adobe, acepte los
Términos de uso adicionales o puede requerir una tarifa independiente para poder acceder a los
Servicios en línea de Adobe. Los Servicios en línea de Adobe quizá no estén disponibles en todos los
idiomas o para residentes de todos los países y Adobe puede, en cualquier momento y por cualquier
razón, modificar o interrumpir la disponibilidad de cualquier Servicio en línea de Adobe. Adobe se
reserva además el derecho a empezar a cobrar una tarifa por acceder a o utilizar un Servicio en línea de
Adobe que previamente se ofreciera gratuitamente. La Sección 14 incluye información importante
relativa a la conectividad a Internet y a la privacidad del Cliente. Como se indica en dicha sección,
cuando el Software accede a un Servicio en línea de Adobe, el uso por parte del Cliente de dicho
Servicio se rige por la Política de privacidad de Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_es), por los
--- Page 397 ---
Términos de uso de Adobe.com (http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_es) y por los Términos de uso
adicionales que se le presenten al Cliente en ese momento.
16.4.2 Proporcionados por terceros. El Software puede facilitar al Cliente acceso a sitios web
mantenidos por terceros que ofrecen bienes, información, software y servicios (“Servicios en línea de
terceros”). Entre los ejemplos de estos Servicios en línea de terceros se incluyen entre otros, el servicio
Kodak EasyShare Gallery. El acceso y el uso por parte del Cliente de Servicios en línea de terceros se
rige por los términos, las condiciones, limitaciones de responsabilidad y avisos encontrados en dicho
sitio o asociados de otro modo a tales Servicios en línea de terceros. Adobe no controla, aprueba ni
acepta ninguna responsabilidad por los Servicios en línea ofrecidos por terceros. Cualquier condición
establecida entre el Cliente y un tercero en relación con Servicios en línea de terceros, incluyendo las
políticas de privacidad de dicho tercero y el uso de la información personal del Cliente, la entrega de y
el pago por los bienes o servicios del Cliente y cualesquiera otros términos, condiciones, garantías, o
representaciones asociados a tales condiciones, serán únicamente entre el Cliente y dicho tercero. Los
Servicios en línea de terceros quizá no estén disponibles en todos los idiomas o para residentes de
todos los países y Adobe puede, en cualquier momento y por cualquier razón, modificar o interrumpir
la disponibilidad de los Servicios en línea de terceros.
16.4.3 SALVO LO ACORDADO EXPRESAMENTE POR ADOBE O SUS FILIALES O TERCEROS EN UN
CONTRATO INDEPENDIENTE, EL USO POR PARTE DEL CLIENTE DE LOS SERVICIOS EN LÍNEA DE

un certificado digital puede estar comprometida debido a un acto u omisión del firmante del
documento, la Entidad de Certificación aplicable o cualquier otro tercero y (c) un certificado puede ser

RESPONSABLE DE LA DECISIÓN DE CONFIAR O NO EN UN CERTIFICADO. A MENOS QUE UNA
ENTIDAD DE CERTIFICACIÓN PROPORCIONE AL CLIENTE UNA GARANTÍA POR ESCRITO APARTE, EL
CLIENTE DEBERÁ UTILIZAR LOS CERTIFICADOS DIGITALES BAJO SU PROPIA RESPONSABILIDAD.

activar, utilizar o permitir que cualquier herramienta de fuente copie, mueva, active o utilice dichas
fuentes dentro de cualquier aplicación de software, programa o archivo que no sea el Software.

2.1 Licencia de Software. La Sección 2.1 se aplica a los Clientes que han comprado una licencia para el
Software, pero no han comprado una licencia o servicio basado en afiliación como la afiliación a
Creative Cloud (como se describe en la Sección 2.2).
2.1.1 Concesión de licencia. Sujeta al cumplimiento por parte del Cliente de este Contrato y del pago de
las tarifas de licencia aplicables, Adobe otorga al Cliente una licencia limitada, no exclusiva para instalar
y usar el Software (a) en el territorio o región donde el Cliente obtiene el Software de Adobe o de un

(“Territorio”), (b) durante el período de vigencia de tal licencia (“Período de vigencia de la licencia”),
(c) dentro del ámbito del Tipo de licencia y en el Número permitido de Equipos compatibles del Cliente
como se especifica en la Documentación y (d) de forma coherente con los términos de este Contrato y
la Documentación aplicable. A menos que se estipule lo contrario en este Contrato, en la
Documentación aplicable o en el momento de la compra, el Período de vigencia de la licencia es a
perpetuidad. Tras la caducidad o terminación del Período de vigencia de la licencia, todo o parte del

número de serie durante el Período de vigencia de la licencia sólo pueden instalarse y utilizarse en
cualquier número de Equipos compatibles como parte de un plan de implementación organizativo
durante el Período de vigencia sólo con fines demostrativos, de evaluación y de formación y sólo si
cualquier Archivo de salida u otros materiales producidos a través de tal uso se utilizan sólo para fines
internos, no comerciales y no relacionados con la producción. EL SOFTWARE SIN NÚMERO DE SERIE SE
PROPORCIONA “TAL CUAL”. EL ACCESO Y EL USO DE TODOS LOS ARCHIVOS DE SALIDA CREADOS
CON EL SOFTWARE SIN NÚMERO DE SERIE SE REALIZA BAJO RIESGO DEL CLIENTE.
2.1.2.2 Software de evaluación. El Software, o partes del Software, que se suministra con un número de
serie designado para “fines de evaluación” u otra designación similar (como Software o número de serie
suministrado como “EVAL” con otro documento de pedido independiente) (“Software de evaluación”)
sólo puede instalarse o utilizarse en el Número permitido de Equipos compatibles del cliente durante el
Período de vigencia de la licencia para demostración, evaluación y formación y sólo si todos los
Archivos de salida o cualquier otro material producido mediante tal uso se emplea únicamente con
finalidades internas, no comerciales y no relacionadas con la producción. EL SOFTWARE DE
--- Page 403 ---
EVALUACIÓN SE PROPORCIONA “TAL CUAL”. EL ACCESO Y EL USO DE TODOS LOS ARCHIVOS DE
SALIDA CREADOS CON EL SOFTWARE DE EVALUACIÓN SE REALIZA BAJO RIESGO DEL CLIENTE.
2.1.2.3 Edición de suscripción. Para el Software disponible según suscripción (“Edición de suscripción”),
el Cliente puede instalar y usar la Edición de suscripción sólo en el Número permitido de Equipos
compatibles del cliente durante el Período de vigencia de la licencia. De acuerdo con el Número
Permitido de Equipos para la Edición de suscripción, Adobe puede permitir que el Cliente instale y use
la versión anterior más reciente de la Edición de suscripción y la versión actual de la Edición de
suscripción en el mismo Equipo durante el Período de vigencia de la licencia. El Cliente acepta que
Adobe puede cambiar el tipo de Software (como componentes específicos, versiones, plataformas,
idiomas, etc.) incluido en la Edición de suscripción en cualquier momento y no será responsable ante el
Cliente por tal cambio. El acceso continuo a una Edición de suscripción requiere: (a) una conexión a
Internet recurrente para activar, renovar y validar la licencia, (b) recibo de Adobe o de su distribuidor
autorizado de los pagos de suscripción recurrente, y (c) aceptación por parte del Cliente de los términos
de suscripción y otros términos y condiciones adicionales disponibles en
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_es o en el momento de la compra. Si Adobe no recibe el
pago de suscripción recurrente o no puede validar la licencia de forma periódica, entonces puede que el
Software quede inactivo sin aviso adicional hasta que Adobe reciba el pago o valide la licencia.
2.1.3 Uso en equipos portátiles o personales. Sujeto a las restricciones establecidas en la siguiente
Sección 2.1.4, el usuario principal del Equipo en el que el Software está instalado según la
Sección 2.1 (“Usuario principal”) puede instalar una segunda copia del Software para su uso
exclusivo en un Equipo portátil o en un Equipo ubicado en su casa, siempre y cuando el Software del
portátil o del equipo doméstico no se utilice al mismo tiempo que el Software del Equipo principal.
2.1.4 Restricciones de uso secundario por licenciatarios múltiples. Si el Software se adquirió bajo un
contrato o programa de Adobe de licencias múltiples (como Adobe Volume Licensing) por cualquier
licenciatario que no sea un licenciatario múltiple para fines educativos, la segunda copia del Software
realizada de acuerdo con la Sección 2.1.3 deberá limitarse sólo al uso y negocio de ese licenciatario
múltiple.
2.1.5 Doble plataforma de arranque. El Software se cede bajo licencia para su uso en una plataforma de
sistema operativo específica. El Cliente debe adquirir una licencia independiente si desea utilizar el
Software en otra plataforma de sistema operativo diferente. Por ejemplo, si el Cliente desea instalar el
Software en plataformas del sistema operativo Mac OS y Windows en un dispositivo que funciona en
ambas plataformas (es decir, un equipo de arranque doble), el Cliente debe obtener dos licencias
diferentes para el Software. Esto es válido incluso si al Cliente se le entregan en el mismo soporte dos
versiones del Software, cada una de ellas para una plataforma de sistema operativo diferente.
2.1.6 Distribución desde un Servidor. Como se indica en la Documentación, el Cliente puede copiar una
imagen del Software en servidores de archivos informáticos dentro de su Red interna (“Servidor”) con la
finalidad de descargar e instalar el Software en Equipos dentro de la misma Red interna para utilizarlo
del modo permitido según se describe en la Sección 2.
2.1.7 Uso en un servidor.
2.1.7.1 Como se indica en un documento independiente de compra o en la Documentación y según las
restricciones de licencia estipuladas en este Contrato, el Cliente puede instalar el Software en un
Servidor sólo con la finalidad de permitir que un individuo desde un Equipo de la misma Red interna
(“Usuario de red”) pueda acceder y usar el Software. El Usuario de red que ha accedido a dicho Software
en el Servidor se denomina “Usuario de software de servidor”. El número total de Usuarios de software
de servidor (no el número simultáneo de usuarios) no puede superar el Número permitido. Como
ejemplo, si un Cliente ha adquirido 10 licencias de Software (el Número permitido es 10) y elige instalar
el Software en un Servidor, entonces el Cliente sólo podrá permitir que hasta 10 Usuarios de software
de servidor accedan al Software (aunque el Cliente pueda tener mas de 10 Usuarios de red o menos
de 10 usuarios concurrentes del Software).
--- Page 404 ---
2.1.7.2 Como aclaración y sin limitación, lo anterior no permite al Cliente instalar o acceder (ya sea
directamente o mediante comandos, datos o instrucciones) al Software: (a) desde o a un Equipo que no
pertenezca a la Red interna del Cliente, (b) para permitir servicios primarios (hosted services) de
Internet o Web, (c) por cualquier usuario que no tenga licencia para utilizar el Software bajo una licencia
válida de Adobe, (d) como parte de un sistema, flujo de trabajo o servicio, accesible para más del
Número permitido de usuarios, o (e) para operaciones no iniciadas por un usuario particular (por
ejemplo, procesamiento de servidores automatizados).

la Afiliación es actual y está activa (“Período de duración de la afiliación”) y (c) de forma coherente con
los términos de este Contrato y la Documentación aplicable. Tras la caducidad o terminación del
Período de duración de la afiliación, (x) puede que todo o parte del Software deje de funcionar sin
previo aviso e (y) el Cliente no podrá utilizar el Software a menos que haya renovado la afiliación. Todos
los términos relacionados con el Software específico como se indica en este Contrato permanecerán
efectivos y seguirán aplicándose al Cliente y a su uso del Software.
2.2.3 Restricciones. El Cliente acepta los siguientes términos y restricciones adicionales relacionados con
la Afiliación. (a) Adobe puede cambiar el tipo de Software (como componentes específicos, versiones,

diseñar, desarrollar y probar sitios web y aplicaciones desarrolladas usando programas de software de
Adobe siempre y cuando el Cliente esté autorizado a copiar y distribuir el Código muestra de la
aplicación (modificado o no modificado) si se cumplen todas estas condiciones: (a) El Cliente distribuye
únicamente las versiones de código del objeto compilado del Código muestra de la aplicación con su
aplicación; (b) el Cliente no incluye el Código muestra de la aplicación en ningún producto o aplicación
diseñada para el desarrollo de páginas web; y (c) el Cliente no usa el nombre, logotipos, iconos o

defender a Adobe de cualquier pérdida, daño, reclamación o demanda incluidos los honorarios de
abogados que pudieran derivarse del uso o distribución de su aplicación.
2.5 Lenguajes de programación. El Software puede incluir partes de los componentes ExtendScript SDK
y Pixel Bender SDK. Sujeto a las restricciones contenidas en esta Sección 2, Adobe otorga al Cliente una
licencia no exclusiva, no transferible y gratuita para utilizar estos elementos en ExtendScript SDK y Pixel
Bender SDK sólo con fines de desarrollo interno de programas diseñados para funcionar con productos
Adobe. Salvo lo permitido en esta Sección 2.5, no se podrá modificar o distribuir ninguna parte de
ExtendScript SDK o Pixel Bender SDK. El Cliente acepta indemnizar, mantener indemne y defender a
Adobe de cualquier pérdida, daño, reclamación o demanda, incluidos los honorarios de abogados que
pudieran derivarse de tal distribución.

13. Cumplimiento de licencias.
Si el Cliente es un negocio, empresa u organización, el Cliente acepta que, además de cualquier
comprobación de cumplimiento de licencia realizada por el Software, Adobe o un representante
autorizado pueden, previo aviso de siete (7) días de antelación, tener derecho una vez cada doce (12)
meses a inspeccionar sus registros, sistemas e instalaciones para comprobar que su uso de cualquier
software o servicio de Adobe cumple con las licencias válidas de Adobe. Por ejemplo, Adobe tiene
derecho a aquellos de los registros útiles del Cliente para determinar si las instalaciones del Software se
han serializado o no, y el Cliente deberá proporcionar puntualmente dichos registros a Adobe cuando
Adobe lo solicite. Asimismo, el Cliente deberá facilitar a Adobe todos los registros y la información
solicitada por Adobe para verificar que su uso de parte y de todo el software de Adobe está en
conformidad con sus licencias válidas de Adobe en un periodo de treinta (30) días a partir de la solicitud
de Adobe. Hay información adicional sobre la serialización disponible en
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_es.
14. Conectividad a Internet y privacidad.
14.1 Conexiones automáticas a Internet. El Software puede hacer que el Equipo del Cliente, sin ningún
aviso, se conecte automáticamente a Internet y se comunique con un sitio web o dominio de Adobe
con fines como validación de licencia y proporcionar al Cliente información, características y funciones
adicionales. A menos que se especifique lo contrario en las Secciones 14.2 a 14.7, se aplicarán las
siguientes disposiciones a todas las conexiones automáticas a Internet realizadas por el Software:
14.1.1 Cuando el Software realice una conexión a Internet y se comunique con un sitio web de Adobe,
tanto automáticamente como a consecuencia de una solicitud explícita del usuario, se aplicará la
Política de privacidad. La Política de privacidad de Adobe permite realizar el seguimiento de las visitas
del sitio web y trata en detalle el tema del seguimiento y el uso de cookies, balizas web y dispositivos
similares.
14.1.2 Cuando el Software se conecta a Adobe a través de Internet, el Software recoge y transmite
determinada información del Cliente a Adobe conforme a la Política de privacidad en línea de Adobe
disponible en http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_es (“Política de privacidad”).
14.1.3 Si el Cliente accede a un Servicio en línea de Adobe (Como se define en la Sección 16.4) o activa
o registra el Software, la información adicional como el ID de Adobe del Cliente, el nombre de usuario y
la contraseña pueden ser transmitidos y almacenados por Adobe según la Política de privacidad y los
términos adicionales de uso relacionados con el Servicio en línea de Adobe (conjuntamente con los
términos de uso de Adobe.com y los términos aplicables, los “Términos de uso adicionales”).
14.1.4 Tal y como se establece en la ley aplicable o ha aceptado el Cliente, Adobe puede (a) enviar al
Cliente mensajes transaccionales para facilitar el Servicio en línea de Adobe o la activación o registro
del Software o el Servicio en línea de Adobe o (b) utilizar técnicas de marketing sobre un producto para
ofrecer información sobre el Software y otros productos y servicios de Adobe utilizando información
que incluye, pero sin limitarse a, la versión de la plataforma, versión del Software, estado de la licencia e
idioma.
14.2 Actualización. El Software puede hacer que el Equipo del Cliente, sin ningún aviso adicional, se
conecte automáticamente a Internet (de manera intermitente o regular) para (a) buscar las
actualizaciones disponibles para su descarga e instalación en el Equipo y (b) para informar a Adobe de
los resultados de sus intentos de instalación.
14.3 Activación. El Software puede requerir que el Cliente (a) obtenga un ID de Adobe, (b) active o
reactive el Software, (c) registre el software o (d) valide la Afiliación. Este requisito puede hacer que el
Equipo del Cliente se conecte a Internet sin aviso al instalar, iniciar o de forma regular. Una vez
conectado, el Software recopilará y transmitirá información a Adobe como se describe en
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_es (“Términos de activación”). El Software o el Cliente pueden
--- Page 411 ---
recibir también información de Adobe relacionada con la licencia, la suscripción o la afiliación del
Cliente. Adobe puede utilizar dicha información para detectar o evitar el uso fraudulento o no
autorizado según una licencia, suscripción o afiliación válidas. Un error al activar o registrar el Software,
validar la suscripción o Afiliación, o una determinación por parte de Adobe de uso fraudulento o no
autorizado del Software puede provocar una funcionalidad reducida o inoperatividad del Software, o la
terminación o suspensión de la suscripción o Afiliación.
14.4 Desactivación. El Cliente puede desactivar e instalar el Software de su Equipo para instalar y activar
el Software en otro Equipo según este contrato (“Desactivación”) y como se describe con más detalle en
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_es. La desactivación requiere conexión a Internet.
14.5 Uso de los Servicios en línea. El Software puede hacer que el Equipo del Cliente, sin ningún aviso
adicional y de forma intermitente o regular, se conecte automáticamente a Internet para permitir al
Cliente acceder a contenido y servicios que Adobe u otros terceros le proporcionan como se describe
detalladamente en la Sección 16.4 (Servicios en línea). Además, el Software puede, sin ningún aviso
adicional, conectarse automáticamente a Internet para actualizar materiales descargables de estos
servicios en línea y proporcionar disponibilidad inmediata incluso cuando el Cliente no está conectado.
14.6 Certificados digitales. El Software utiliza certificados digitales (como se describe en la Sección 16.5)
para ayudar al Cliente a identificar los archivos descargados (por ejemplo, aplicaciones y contenido) y a
los editores de esos archivos. Por ejemplo, Adobe AIR utiliza certificados digitales para ayudar al Cliente
a identificar al editor de las aplicaciones Adobe AIR. La familia de productos de Adobe Acrobat utiliza
certificados digitales para firmar y validar las firmas de los documentos en formato portátil (“PDF”), así
como para validar los documentos PDF certificados. El Equipo del Cliente puede conectarse a Internet
en el momento de la validación de un certificado digital.
14.7 Administrador de configuración. El Software puede incluir Flash Player. Flash Player puede guardar
algunas configuraciones de usuario almacenándolas como objetos locales compartidos en el Equipo del
Cliente. Están asociadas a la instancia de Flash Player en el Equipo, lo que le permite que el Cliente
personalice características de tiempo de ejecución. El Administrador de configuración de Flash Player
permite al Cliente modificar esas configuraciones, incluida la capacidad de limitar el derecho de que
terceros almacenen objetos locales compartidos o conceder al contenido de terceros el derecho a
acceder al micrófono y la cámara de su equipo. Hay más información acerca de la definición de las
configuraciones en su versión de Flash Player, incluyendo información sobre cómo desactivar objetos
locales compartidos con el Administrador de configuración de Flash Player disponible en
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_es. Hay más información acerca de los objetos locales
compartidos disponible en http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_es.
15. Comunicaciones de punto a punto.
El Software puede utilizar la conexión del Cliente a una red de área local, sin ningún aviso adicional,
para conectarse automáticamente con otro software de Adobe y, al hacerlo, puede indicar en la red de
área local que se encuentra disponible para la comunicación con otro software de Adobe. Estas
conexiones pueden transmitir la Dirección IP de la conexión del Cliente a la red de área local.
16. Disposiciones y excepciones específicas.
Esta sección expone las disposiciones específicas relacionadas con ciertos productos y componentes del
Software, así como las excepciones limitadas a las condiciones arriba indicadas. En la medida en que
cualquier disposición recogida en esta sección esté en conflicto con cualquier otra condición de este
contrato, los términos establecidos en esta sección prevalecerán sobre tal otra condición.
16.1 Sin perjuicios; Disposiciones del Espacio Económico Europeo; Aviso obligatorio en Australia.
--- Page 412 ---
16.1.1 Este contrato no perjudicará a los derechos legales de cualquier parte, incluyendo los de los
consumidores. Por ejemplo, para los consumidores en Nueva Zelanda que obtengan el Software para
uso personal, doméstico o casero (sin propósitos comerciales), esta licencia está sujeta a la Ley de
Garantías del Consumidor.
16.1.2 Si el Cliente ha obtenido el Software en el Espacio Económico Europeo (EEE), el Cliente reside
normalmente en el EEE y es un consumidor (esto es, usa el Software para uso personal), la Sección 6
(Garantía limitada) no se aplicará a la compra y uso del Software por parte del Cliente. En su lugar,
Adobe garantiza durante un período de 2 años a partir de la fecha de compra que el Software
proporciona las funcionalidades establecidas en el manual del usuario aplicable (las “funcionalidades
convenidas”) cuando se utilice con la configuración del equipo recomendada. No se establecerá
derecho de garantía para el caso de variaciones no sustanciales según lo indicado en la Documentación.
ESTA GARANTÍA NO SE APLICARÁ AL SOFTWARE QUE USE EL CLIENTE EN PRELANZAMIENTOS,
PRUEBAS, PRODUCTOS BÁSICOS (STARTER), MUESTRAS DE PRODUCTOS O PARA EL SOFTWARE DE
FUENTE O EN LA MEDIDA EN QUE FALLE EL SOFTWARE POR HABER SIDO MODIFICADO POR EL
CLIENTE. Para efectuar cualquier reclamación de garantía, el Cliente debe avisar al Departamento de
atención al cliente de Adobe durante este período de 2 años y proporcionar detalles del comprobante
de compra del Software. Adobe comprobará con el Cliente si existe un defecto en el Software o le
advertirá de que el error se debe a una instalación incorrecta del Software (en ese caso, Adobe no
proporcionará asistencia al Cliente). Si existe un defecto en el Software, el Cliente puede solicitar que
Adobe le reembolse su precio o le proporcione una copia reparada o de sustitución del Software. Las
solicitudes deben ir acompañadas del comprobante de compra. En caso de que se prueben los detalles
de la garantía del Cliente, Adobe proporcionará al Cliente el Software reparado o de sustitución
solicitado, a menos que no sea razonable para Adobe, en cuyo caso Adobe le reembolsará al Cliente su
precio. Para obtener asistencia sobre la garantía, póngase en contacto con el Departamento de atención
al cliente de Adobe.
Tenga en cuenta que las disposiciones de la Sección 8 (Limitación de la responsabilidad) seguirán
aplicándose a todas las reclamaciones por daños que el Cliente realice con respecto a su uso del
Software. Sin embargo, Adobe será responsable de las pérdidas directas que se puedan predecir
razonablemente en caso de que Adobe incumpla este contrato. Es aconsejable que el Cliente tome
todas las medidas razonables para evitar y reducir los daños; en especial, realizar copias de seguridad
del Software y de sus datos informáticos.
Este contrato y, en particular, esta Sección 16.1.2, tiene la finalidad de exponer los derechos del Cliente
(incluidos sus derechos legales) en caso de que surjan problemas relacionados con el uso del Software.
Si los derechos legales del Cliente son más amplios que esta descripción, se aplicarán sus derechos
legales.
16.1.3 Nada incluido en este contrato (incluida la Sección 4.4) limitará ningún derecho irrenunciable a
descompilar el Software que le otorgue al Cliente la legislación aplicable. Por ejemplo, si el Cliente se
encuentra en la Unión Europea (UE), es posible que el Cliente tenga derecho en determinadas
condiciones especificadas en la legislación pertinente a descompilar el Software, si necesita hacerlo para
lograr la interoperabilidad del Software con otro programa de software y si el Cliente hubiera solicitado
primero a Adobe que le proporcionara la información necesaria para conseguir esa operatividad y
Adobe no le hubiera facilitado dicha información. Además, dicha descompilación sólo podrá realizarla
el Cliente o algún otro usuario con derecho a utilizar una copia del Software en nombre del Cliente.
Adobe se reserva el derecho de establecer condiciones razonables antes de facilitar la referida
información. Cualquier información facilitada por Adobe u obtenida por el Cliente, según se establece
en este contrato, sólo podrá ser usada por el Cliente para la finalidad descrita aquí y no podrá ser
revelada a terceros ni usada para crear ningún software que sea sustancialmente similar a la expresión
del Software o utilizada para cualquier acción que infrinja los derechos de autor de Adobe o sus
otorgantes de licencia.
16.1.4 Si el Cliente obtiene el Software en Australia, se aplicará la siguiente disposición, sin perjuicio de
nada establecido en este Contrato:
--- Page 413 ---

16.2 Términos adicionales de Software de prelanzamiento. Si el Software es una versión de
prelanzamiento o Software versión beta (“Software de prelanzamiento”), será aplicable esta sección. El
Software de prelanzamiento no representa un producto final de Adobe y puede contener virus, errores
y otros problemas que podrían causar fallos en el sistema o de otro tipo, así como la pérdida de datos.
Es posible que Adobe nunca lance comercialmente el Software de prelanzamiento. Si el Cliente ha
recibido el Software de prelanzamiento de conformidad con un contrato escrito por separado, como el
contrato para productos de prelanzamiento de Adobe Systems Incorporated para el Software de
prelanzamiento, (Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release Software), el uso que
haga del Software el Cliente estará regulado igualmente por dicho contrato. El Cliente debe
comprometerse a devolver o destruir todas las copias del Software de prelanzamiento de forma
inmediata si así lo solicita Adobe o cuando Adobe comercialice dicho Software. EL CLIENTE UTILIZA EL
SOFTWARE DE PRELANZAMIENTO BAJO SU PROPIO RIESGO. CONSULTE LAS SECCIONES 6 Y 8 PARA
LA GARANTÍA LIMITADA Y LAS LIMITACIONES DE RESPONSABILIDAD QUE RIGEN EL SOFTWARE DE
PRELANZAMIENTO.
16.3 Software educativo. Si el Software es un Software educativo (Software fabricado y distribuido para
su uso por Usuarios finales de la línea educativa), el Cliente sólo estará autorizado a utilizar dicho
programa si cumple las condiciones de Usuario final de la línea educativa dentro de su jurisdicción.
Visite http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_es para obtener información sobre la idoneidad.
Visite http://www.adobe.com/go/store_es y busque el enlace para la compra de productos Adobe en
todo el mundo para buscar un Distribuidor de educación autorizado.
16.4 Servicios en línea.
16.4.1 Proporcionados por Adobe. El Software facilita al Cliente el acceso al contenido y los diversos
servicios albergados en sitios web mantenidos por Adobe o sus filiales (“Servicios en línea de Adobe”).
Entre los ejemplos de estos Servicios en línea de Adobe se incluyen entre otros: Adobe BrowserLab,

de bienvenida de productos. En algunos casos un Servicio en línea de Adobe puede aparecer como una
función o una extensión dentro del Software incluso si se aloja en un sitio web. El acceso a un Servicio
en línea de Adobe puede requerir que el Cliente active el Software, obtenga un ID de Adobe, acepte los
Términos de uso adicionales o puede requerir una tarifa independiente para poder acceder a los
Servicios en línea de Adobe. Los Servicios en línea de Adobe quizá no estén disponibles en todos los
idiomas o para residentes de todos los países y Adobe puede, en cualquier momento y por cualquier
razón, modificar o interrumpir la disponibilidad de cualquier Servicio en línea de Adobe. Adobe se
reserva además el derecho a empezar a cobrar una tarifa por acceder a o utilizar un Servicio en línea de
Adobe que previamente se ofreciera gratuitamente. La Sección 14 incluye información importante
relativa a la conectividad a Internet y a la privacidad del Cliente. Como se indica en dicha sección,
cuando el Software accede a un Servicio en línea de Adobe, el uso por parte del Cliente de dicho
Servicio se rige por la Política de privacidad de Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_es), por los
--- Page 414 ---
Términos de uso de Adobe.com (http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_es) y por los Términos de uso
adicionales que se le presenten al Cliente en ese momento.
16.4.2 Proporcionados por terceros. El Software puede facilitar al Cliente acceso a sitios web
mantenidos por terceros que ofrecen bienes, información, software y servicios (“Servicios en línea de
terceros”). Entre los ejemplos de estos Servicios en línea de terceros se incluyen entre otros, el servicio
Kodak EasyShare Gallery. El acceso y el uso por parte del Cliente de Servicios en línea de terceros se
rige por los términos, las condiciones, limitaciones de responsabilidad y avisos encontrados en dicho
sitio o asociados de otro modo a tales Servicios en línea de terceros. Adobe no controla, aprueba ni
acepta ninguna responsabilidad por los Servicios en línea ofrecidos por terceros. Cualquier condición
establecida entre el Cliente y un tercero en relación con Servicios en línea de terceros, incluyendo las
políticas de privacidad de dicho tercero y el uso de la información personal del Cliente, la entrega de y
el pago por los bienes o servicios del Cliente y cualesquiera otros términos, condiciones, garantías, o
representaciones asociados a tales condiciones, serán únicamente entre el Cliente y dicho tercero. Los
Servicios en línea de terceros quizá no estén disponibles en todos los idiomas o para residentes de
todos los países y Adobe puede, en cualquier momento y por cualquier razón, modificar o interrumpir
la disponibilidad de los Servicios en línea de terceros.
16.4.3 SALVO LO ACORDADO EXPRESAMENTE POR ADOBE O SUS FILIALES O TERCEROS EN UN
CONTRATO INDEPENDIENTE, EL USO POR PARTE DEL CLIENTE DE LOS SERVICIOS EN LÍNEA DE

16.5.3 Reconocimiento. El Cliente acepta que (a) el Software, debido a problemas externos o de
configuración, pueda mostrar una firma como válida a pesar del hecho de que el certificado digital se
haya rechazado o haya vencido antes del momento de verificación, (b) la seguridad o la integridad de
un certificado digital puede estar comprometida debido a un acto u omisión del firmante del
documento, la Entidad de Certificación aplicable o cualquier otro tercero y (c) un certificado puede ser
un certificado autofirmado no proporcionado por una Entidad de Certificación. EL CLIENTE ES EL ÚNICO
RESPONSABLE DE LA DECISIÓN DE CONFIAR O NO EN UN CERTIFICADO. A MENOS QUE UNA
ENTIDAD DE CERTIFICACIÓN PROPORCIONE AL CLIENTE UNA GARANTÍA POR ESCRITO APARTE, EL
CLIENTE DEBERÁ UTILIZAR LOS CERTIFICADOS DIGITALES BAJO SU PROPIA RESPONSABILIDAD.

activar, utilizar o permitir que cualquier herramienta de fuente copie, mueva, active o utilice dichas
fuentes dentro de cualquier aplicación de software, programa o archivo que no sea el Software.
16.7 Render Engine de After Effects. Si el Software incluye una versión completa de Adobe After Effects,
entonces el Cliente puede instalar un número ilimitado de Render Engines en Equipos en su Red interna
que incluya al menos un Equipo en el cual la versión completa del software de Adobe After Effects esté
instalada. El término “Render Engine” significa cualquier parte instalable del Software que permite que
los proyectos After Effects puedan ser ejecutados pero que no se puede utilizar para crear o modificar
proyectos y no incluye la interfaz de usuario After Effects completa.

2. Programvarulicens; Medlemskap.
2.1 Programvarulicens. Detta avsnitt 2.1 gäller för kunder som har köpt en licens för programvaran men
som inte har köpt en medlemskapsbaserad licens eller tjänst, t.ex. ett Creative Cloud-medlemskap
(enligt beskrivningen i avsnitt 2.2).
2.1.1 Beviljande av licens. Förutsatt att kunden fortlöpande uppfyller villkoren i detta Avtal och betalar
tillämpliga licensavgifter beviljar Adobe kunden en icke-exklusiv och begränsad licens att installera och
använda programvaran (a) i den region eller det land där kunden erhåller programvaran från Adobe
eller en auktoriserad Adobe-återförsäljare eller på något annat sätt som anges i dokumentationen
(”Området”), (b) under den aktuella licensperioden (”licensperiod”), (c) inom licenstypens omfattning
och på det tillåtna antalet kompatibla datorer hos kunden i enlighet med dokumentationen, samt (d) på
ett sätt som följer villkoren i detta Avtal och tillämplig dokumentation. Förutsatt att inget annat anges i
detta Avtal, i den tillämpliga dokumentationen eller vid inköpstillfället löper licensperioden på
obestämd tid. Efter licensperiodens upphörande eller uppsägning kan delar av eller hela programvaran
sluta att fungera utan föregående meddelande. Efter licensperiodens upphörande eller uppsägning får
kunden inte använda programvaran utan att först ha förnyat licensen. Den licens som härmed beviljas
kompletteras av de specifika villkoren i avsnitt 16 vad gäller användningen av vissa tillämpliga
produkter och komponenter som kan ingå i programvaran, t.ex. programvara för teckensnitt, Acrobat,
After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player, Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite samt
Adobe Runtimes.
2.1.2 Licenstyper.
2.1.2.1 Programvara utan serienummer. Programvara eller delar av programvara som tillhandahålls utan
serienummer under licensperioden får endast installeras och användas på valfritt antal kompatibla
datorer som ett led i distributionsplanen inom en organisation under licensperioden i demonstrations-,
utvärderings- och utbildningssyfte och då endast förutsatt att eventuella utdatafiler eller annat material
som framställs genom sådan användning endast används för interna, icke-kommersiella och icke
produktionsmässiga syften. PROGRAMVARA UTAN SERIENUMMER TILLHANDAHÅLLS ”I BEFINTLIGT
SKICK”. ÅTKOMST TILL OCH ANVÄNDNING AV EVENTUELLA UTDATAFILER SOM SKAPATS MED
SÅDAN PROGRAMVARA UTAN SERIENUMMER SKER HELT OCH HÅLLET PÅ KUNDENS RISK.
2.1.2.2 Utvärderingsprogramvara. Programvara eller delar av programvara som tillhandahålls med ett
serienummer för ”utvärderingssyften” eller liknande syften (exempelvis programvara eller ett
serienummer som benämns ”EVAL” och omfattas av ett separat avtal) (”Utvärderingsprogramvara”) får
endast installeras och användas på det tillåtna antalet kompatibla datorer under licensperioden i
demonstrations-, utvärderings- och utbildningssyfte, och endast om eventuella utdatafiler eller annat
material som produceras till följd av sådan användning endast används i interna, icke-kommersiella och
icke produktionsmässiga syften. UTVÄRDERINGSPROGRAMVARA TILLHANDAHÅLLS ”I BEFINTLIGT
SKICK”. ÅTKOMST TILL OCH ANVÄNDNING AV EVENTUELLA UTDATAFILER SOM SKAPATS MED
SÅDAN UTVÄRDERINGSPROGRAMVARA SKER HELT OCH HÅLLET PÅ KUNDENS RISK.
--- Page 420 ---
2.1.2.3 Prenumerationsversion. När det gäller programvara som tillhandahålls på prenumerationsbasis
(”Prenumerationsversion”), får kunden endast installera och använda Prenumerationsversionen på det
tillåtna antalet kompatibla datorer under licensperioden. Förutsatt att det tillåts av
Prenumerationsversionens tillåtna antal datorer, kan Adobe tillåta kunden att installera och använda
den senaste tidigare versionen av Prenumerationsversionen tillsammans med den senaste aktuella
versionen av Prenumerationsversionen på samma dator under licensperioden. Kunden accepterar att
Adobe när som helst kan ändra den typ av programvara (t.ex. specifika komponenter, versioner,
plattformar, språk o.s.v.) som ingår i Prenumerationsversionen och inte kan hållas ansvarigt inför
kunden för sådan ändring. Löpande tillgång till en Prenumerationsversion kräver: (a) en återkommande
Internet-anslutning för att aktivera, förnya och validera licensen, (b) att Adobe eller dess auktoriserade
återförsäljare erhåller regelbundna prenumerationsavgifter samt (c) att kunden accepterar
prenumerationsvillkoren och andra ytterligare villkor som redovisas på
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_se eller vid köptillfället. Om Adobe inte erhåller den
regelbundna prenumerationsavgiften eller inte får möjlighet att med jämna mellanrum validera licensen
kan programvaran komma att avaktiveras utan ytterligare meddelande fram till dess att Adobe erhåller
betalning för avgiften eller validerar licensen.
2.1.3 Användning på bärbar dator eller Hemdator. Med förbehåll för de begränsningar som
redovisas i avsnitt 2.1.4 får den huvudsakliga användaren av den dator där programvaran är
installerad enligt avsnitt 2.1 (”Huvudsaklig Användare”) installera ett andra exemplar av
programvaran för eget bruk på antingen en bärbar dator eller en dator som är placerad i
vederbörandes hem, under förutsättning att programvaran på den bärbara datorn eller hemdatorn
inte används samtidigt som programvaran på den primära datorn.
2.1.4 Begränsningar av volymlicenstagarens subsidiära användning. Om programvaran erhölls under
Adobes volymlicensprogram eller -avtal (t.ex. Adobe Volume Licensing) av en licenstagare som inte är
en licenstagare av en utbildningsvolymlicens, får det andra exemplaret som installeras enligt
avsnitt 2.1.3 endast användas till förmån för denne volymlicenstagare och i dennes affärsverksamhet.
2.1.5 Plattform med dubbla operativsystem. Kunden måste köpa en separat licens för att kunna
använda programvaran på varje operativsystemsplattform. Om kunden exempelvis vill installera
programvaran på både operativsystemsplattformen Mac OS och Windows, på en enhet som kör båda
dessa plattformar (det vill säga en maskin med dubbla operativsystem), så måste kunden först
införskaffa två separata programvarulicenser. Detta gäller även om två versioner av programvaran, var
och en avsedd för en separat operativsystemsplattform, levereras till kunden på samma medium.
2.1.6 Distribution från en server. I enlighet med det som tillåts enligt dokumentationen får kunden
kopiera programvaran till en datorfilserver i kundens interna nätverk (”Server”) i syfte att kunna ladda
ner och installera programvaran på datorer i samma interna nätverk endast för den användning som
tillåts enligt detta avsnitt 2.
2.1.7 Serveranvändning.
2.1.7.1 På det sätt som det tillåts genom ett separat köpdokument eller i dokumentationen och
underkastat de licensbegränsningar som anges i detta Avtal får kunden endast installera programvaran
på en Server i syfte att tillåta en person från en dator i samma interna nätverk (”Nätverksanvändare”) att
komma åt och använda programvaran. Den Nätverksanvändare som får åtkomst till sådan programvara
på Servern kallas ”Användare av serverprogramvara”. Det totala antalet Användare av
serverprogramvara (inte antalet samtidiga användare) får inte överskrida det tillåtna antalet. Exempel:
Om kunden har köpt 10 licenser för programvaran (Det tillåtna antalet är 10) och väljer att installera
programvaran på en Server, får kunden endast tillåta att högst 10 Användare av serverprogramvara får
tillgång till programvaran (även om kunden kan ha fler än 10 Nätverksanvändare eller färre än 10
samtidiga användare av programvaran).
2.1.7.2 För tydlighets skull och utan begränsning, medger inte det föregående att kunden installerar eller
får åtkomst till programvaran (antingen direkt eller via kommandon, data eller instruktioner): (a) från
eller till en dator som inte ingår i kundens interna nätverk, (b) för att aktivera webbaserade
--- Page 421 ---
arbetsgrupper eller tjänster som tillgängliggörs för allmänheten, (c) att en annan individ eller juridisk
person kan använda, ladda ner, kopiera eller på annat sätt dra nytta av funktionerna i programvaran om
inte denna rätt har licensierats av Adobe, (d) som en komponent i ett system, ett arbetsflöde eller en
tjänst som är tillgänglig för fler än det tillåtna antalet användare eller (e) för förfaranden som inte
initierats av en enskild användare (exempelvis automatisk serverbehandling).
2.2 Medlemskap. Detta avsnitt 2.2 gäller för kunder som har köpt en medlemskapsbaserad licens eller
tjänst, t.ex. Creative Cloud-medlemskap (kollektivt benämnt ”medlemskap”).
2.2.1 Adobe-onlinetjänster som är kopplade till medlemskapet. Förutsatt att kunden fortlöpande
uppfyller villkoren i detta Avtal och betalar eventuella tillämpliga medlemskapsavgifter beviljar Adobe
kunden en icke-exklusiv, regionsomfattande och begränsad rätt att komma åt och använda
programvaran och den relaterade Adobe-onlinetjänsten (som beskrivs ytterligare i avsnitt 16.4.1) som
en del av medlemskapet, i enlighet med villkoren i detta Avtal och de ytterligare villkoren (så som
begreppet definieras i avsnitt 14.1.3 nedan).
2.2.2 Programvarulicens relaterad till medlemskapet. Förutsatt att kunden fortlöpande uppfyller
villkoren i detta Avtal och betalar eventuella tillämpliga medlemskapsavgifter beviljar Adobe kunden en
icke-exklusiv och begränsad licens att installera och använda programvaran: (a) i regionen, (b) under
den period som medlemskapet är aktuellt och aktivt (”medlemskapsperiod”) samt (c) på ett sätt som
följer villkoren i detta Avtal och tillämplig dokumentation. Efter medlemskapsperiodens upphörande
eller uppsägning (x) kan delar av eller hela programvaran sluta att fungera utan föregående
meddelande och (y) kunden får inte använda programvaran förrän medlemskapet har förnyats.
Samtliga villkor som rör den specifika programvaran som redovisas i detta Avtal fortsätter att gälla för
kunden och dennes användning av sådan programvara.
2.2.3 Begränsningar. Kunden accepterar följande ytterligare villkor och begränsningar i medlemskapet:
(a) Adobe får när som helst ändra den typ av programvara (t.ex. specifika produkter, komponenter,
versioner, plattformar, språk o.s.v.) som ingår i medlemskapet och kan inte på något sätt hållas ansvarigt
inför kunden för sådan ändring, (b) kunden kan när som helst under medlemskapsperioden uppmanas
att ansluta till Internet och logga in, (c) programvaran får när som helst och utan föregående
meddelande ansluta till Internet automatiskt för att verifiera kundens medlemskap, samt (d) kunden får
inte möjliggöra för eller tillåta andra att använda programvaran och utge sig för att vara kunden.
2.3 Innehållsfiler. Såvida inget annat anges i ”Viktigt”-filerna, dokumentationen eller andra licenser som
är kopplade till Innehållsfilerna får kunden använda, visa, ändra, reproducera och distribuera
Innehållsfiler. Kunden får dock inte distribuera Innehållsfilerna på fristående basis (d.v.s. där
Innehållsfilerna utgör det huvudsakliga värdet av den produkt som distribueras) och kunden får inte
göra anspråk på några varumärkesrättigheter med avseende på Innehållsfilerna eller arbeten som
härletts från dessa. Ingenting av det som redovisas häri ska påverka äganderätten till programvaran
enligt beskrivningen i avsnitt 3.
2.4 Programkodsexempel. Kunden får endast ändra källkodsformen i de delar av programvaran som
uttryckligen identifieras som ”exempelkod”, ”programkodsexempel”, ”kodstycken”, ActionScript-
klassfiler eller ”exempelkomponenter” (var för sig ”programkodsexempel”) i den tillhörande
dokumentationen i syfte att utforma, utveckla och testa webbplatser och program som har utvecklats
med Adobe-programvara, dock under förutsättning att kunden endast har tillåtelse att kopiera och
distribuera programkodsexempel (i ändrad eller oförändrad form) om samtliga följande villkor uppfylls:
(a) kunden distribuerar endast de kompilerade versionerna av objektkoden från programkodsexempel
med kundens program, (b) Kunden inkluderar inte programkodsexempel i någon produkt eller något
program som är utformat för utveckling av webbplatser, samt (c) kunden använder inte Adobes namn,
logotyper, ikoner eller andra varumärken som tillhör Adobe i marknadsföringen av sina program.
Kunden accepterar att ersätta, försvara och hålla Adobe skadeslöst från alla eventuella förluster, skador,
anspråk eller stämningar, inklusive ombudskostnader, som uppkommer eller är ett resultat av
användningen eller distributionen av kundens program.
--- Page 422 ---
2.5 Programmeringsspråk. Programvaran kan innehålla delar av ExtendScript SDK och Pixel Bender
SDK. Med förbehåll för begränsningarna i detta avsnitt 2 beviljar Adobe kunden en icke-exklusiv, icke-
överlåtbar, royaltybefriad licens att använda innehållet i ExtendScript SDK och Pixel Bender SDK endast
för intern utveckling av tillämpningsprogram avsedda att fungera med Adobe-produkter. Utöver vad
som uttryckligen anges i detta avsnitt 2.5 får inga delar av ExtendScript SDK eller Pixel Bender SDK
ändras eller distribueras. Kunden accepterar att ersätta, försvara och hålla Adobe skadeslöst från alla
eventuella förluster, skador, anspråk eller stämningar, inklusive ombudskostnader, som uppkommer
eller är ett resultat av sådan distribution.
2.6 Kopior av dokumentationen. Kunden får göra kopior av dokumentationen för egen intern
användning i samband med användning av programvaran i enlighet med detta Avtal, men inte i mer än
skäligen nödvändig omfattning.
3. Immaterialrättsinnehav.
Programvaran och alla auktoriserade kopior som kunden framställer skyddas av immateriella
rättigheter som ägs av Adobe Systems Incorporated och dess leverantörer. Programvarans struktur,
organisation och källkod utgör värdefulla företagshemligheter och konfidentiell information som tillhör
Adobe Systems Incorporated och dess leverantörer. Programvaran är skyddad enligt lag, inklusive men
inte begränsat till upphovsrättslagstiftning i USA och andra länder samt internationella konventioner.
Med undantag för det som uttryckligen redovisas häri beviljar inte detta Avtal kunden någon
immateriell rättighet till programvaran. Adobe och dess leverantörer förbehåller sig rätten till samtliga
rättigheter som inte uttryckligen beviljas enligt detta Avtal.
4. Begränsningar och krav.
4.1 Immaterialrättsliga meddelanden. Om kunden gör tillåtna kopior av programvaran (inklusive, utan
begränsning, dokumentationen) måste dessa märkas med samma upphovsrättsmeddelanden och
andra äganderättsliga meddelanden som finns på eller i programvaran.
4.2 Skyldigheter vid användning. Kunden förbinder sig att inte använda programvaran på något annat
sätt än vad detta Avtal medger och att inte använda programvaran på ett sätt som inte överensstämmer
med dess konstruktion eller dokumentation.
4.3 Inga ändringar. Förutom vad som är uttryckligen tillåtet enligt avsnitt 2 och 16 får kunden inte ändra,
portera, anpassa eller översätta programvaran.
4.4 Ingen bakåtkompilering. Förutom vad som är uttryckligen tillåtet enligt avsnitt 16.1 får kunden inte
bakåtkompilera, ändra filens innehåll, eller på annat sätt försöka att utvinna källkoden i programvaran.
4.5 Ingen separation. Programvaran kan innehålla flera program och komponenter, tillåta åtkomst till
olika Adobe-onlinetjänster, stödja flera plattformar och språk, och kan tillhandahållas på flera medier
eller i flera exemplar. Trots detta är programvaran utformad som och tillhandahålls till kunden som en
enda produkt som ska användas som en enda produkt på datorer på det sätt som detta Avtal tillåter.
Med undantag för det som enligt dokumentationen är tillåtet behöver kunden inte installera samtliga
delar av programvaran, men kunden får inte dela upp programvarans olika komponentdelar för
användning på olika datorer.
4.6 Ingen överlåtelse.
4.6.1 KUNDEN FÅR INTE HYRA UT, LEASA UT, SÄLJA, VIDARELICENSIERA, ÖVERFÖRA ELLER
ÖVERLÅTA SINA RÄTTIGHETER TILL PROGRAMVARAN (INKLUSIVE, UTAN ATT BEGRÄNSAS TILL
PROGRAMVARA SOM ERHÅLLS VIA NEDLADDNING FRÅN INTERNET), ELLER GODKÄNNA ATT
NÅGON DEL AV PROGRAMVARAN KOPIERAS TILL EN ANNAN FYSISK ELLER JURIDISK PERSONS
DATOR, FÖRUTOM VAD SOM UTTRYCKLIGEN TILLÅTS I DETTA AVTAL.
--- Page 423 ---
4.6.2 Med undantag för Utbildningsprogramvara (enligt definitionen i avsnitt 16.3), Förhandsversioner
(enligt definitionen i avsnitt 16.2), Utvärderingsprogramvara, icke saluförda exemplar av programvaran,
eller programvara som erhålls via något Adobe-volymlicensieringsprogram och som därmed omfattas
av villkoren i avsnitt 4.6.3, får kunden permanent överlåta samtliga sina rättigheter att använda
programvaran till en annan fysisk eller juridisk person, förutsatt att: (a) kunden även överlåter (i) detta
avtal, (ii) serienummer, programvaran på det medium som Adobe eller dess auktoriserade distributör
tillhandahållit samt all annan programvara eller maskinvara som levererats tillsammans med eller
förinstallerats med programvaran, inklusive alla kopior, Uppdateringar och Tidigare versioner (enligt
definitionerna i avsnitt 5 nedan), och (iii) samtliga kopior av teckensnittsprogramvara till denna fysiska
eller juridiska person, (b) kunden inte behåller några Uppdateringar, Tidigare versioner eller kopior,
inklusive säkerhetskopior och kopior som lagrats på en dator, samt (c) att den mottagande parten
accepterar villkoren i detta avtal och övriga villkor som gällde vid kundens inköp av en giltig licens för
programvaran. Ytterligare information om överlåtelse av volymlicensierad programvara finns på
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_se.
4.6.3 Om programvaran kräver återkommande aktivering eller registrering och Adobe beviljar kundens
begäran om att undantas från kravet på sådan återkommande aktivering eller registrering, kommer,
utöver de begränsningar som redovisas i Villkor för aktivering (enligt definitionen i avsnitt 14.3), rätten
att permanent överlåta programvaran som redovisas i avsnitt 4.6.2 omedelbart upphöra vid beviljandet
av sådan begäran.
4.7 Inget dataserviceföretag. Kunden får inte använda eller erbjuda användning av programvaran på
dataserviceföretagsbasis. Det undantag som fastställs i avsnitt 16.6.3 är begränsat till endast
teckensnittsprogramvara.
4.8 Begränsningar för Adobe Runtime. Kunden får inte använda Adobe Runtimes på en icke-PC-produkt
eller med någon inbäddad version eller enhetsversion av ett operativsystem. För att undanröja
eventuella missförstånd illustrerar vi med följande exempel: kunden får inte använda Adobe Runtimes i
(a) mobilenheter, digitalboxar, handhållna enheter, telefoner, spelkonsoler, tv-apparater, dvd-spelare,
mediacenter (med undantag för Windows XP Media Center Edition och efterföljare), elektroniska
anslagstavlor eller andra digitala anslag, Internet-enheter eller andra produkter som är anslutna till
Internet, handdatorer (PDA), medicinska enheter, bankomater, telematikenheter, spelmaskiner,
hemautomatiseringssystem, kiosker, fjärrkontroller eller andra konsumentelektronikprodukter,
(b) operatörsbaserade mobilsystem eller kabel-, satellit- eller televisionssystem, eller (c) andra slutna
systemenheter. Ytterligare information om licensiering av Adobe Runtimes finns på
http://www.adobe.com/go/licensing_se.
4.9 Region. Kunden får endast använda programvaran och Adobes onlinetjänster i regionen och på ett
sätt som överensstämmer med aktiveringspolicyn som beskrivs på
http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_se. Adobe kan avsluta den licens som härmed beviljas eller
upphäva medlemskapet eller åtkomsten till Adobes onlinetjänster om Adobe anser att kunden
använder programvaran eller Adobes onlinetjänster utanför regionen.
5. Uppdateringar.
Om programvaran är en Uppdatering av en Tidigare version av Adobe-programvaran (den ”Tidigare
versionen”) är kundens användning av sådan Uppdatering villkorad av att den Tidigare versionen är
kvar i kundens ägo. Därför måste kunden, vid en överlåtelse av Uppdateringen i enlighet med
avsnitt 4.6, även samtidigt överlåta den Tidigare versionen. Om kunden utöver den Tidigare versionen
också vill använda denna Uppdatering får sådan användning endast ske på samma dator som den där
kunden har installerat och använder den Tidigare versionen. Adobes eventuella åtaganden under
licensperioden när det gäller support för Tidigare versioner kan upphöra i och med att denna
Uppdatering blir tillgänglig. Ingen annan användning av Uppdateringen är tillåten. Vid licensering av fler
Uppdateringar till kunden äger Adobe rätt att ändra eller göra tillägg till Avtalet.

6. Begränsad garanti.
Med undantag för det som anges i ett separat avtal mellan Adobe och en licenstagare av programvara,
garanterar Adobe den fysiska eller juridiska person som först köper en licens för programvaran för
användning i enlighet med villkoren i detta Avtal, att programvaran väsentligen kommer att fungera i
enlighet med beskrivningen i motsvarande programvaras användarhandbok under den kortare
perioden av (a) nittio (90) dagar eller (b) licensperioden efter mottagning av programvaran
(”Garantiperioden”) när den används på en kompatibel dator. Om programvaran på ett icke väsentligt
sätt avviker från prestandan enligt användarhandboken innebär detta ingen garantirätt. Denna
begränsade garanti omfattar inte följande, som tillhandahålls i befintligt skick och utan någon garanti
från Adobe: (i) korrigeringsfiler, (ii) teckensnittsprogramvara, (iii) Förhandsversioner, testversioner,
startversioner, Utvärderingsversioner, produktprovsversioner samt icke saluförda exemplar av
programvaran, (iv) webbsidor, Adobes onlinetjänster och tredje parters onlinetjänster, (v) Certified
Document Services (se avsnitt 16), samt (vi) eventuell programvara som Adobe gör tillgänglig för
kostnadsfri nedladdning från en Adobe-webbplats. Samtliga garantianspråk måste framställas till
Adobes kundtjänst, tillsammans med inköpsbevis, inom en sådan Garantiperiod. Ytterligare information
om garantianspråk finns på http://www.adobe.com/go/support_se. Adobes och dess närstående bolags
hela ansvar vad gäller sådant garantianspråk, och kundens enda och exklusiva kompensation i enlighet
med någon garanti begränsas till antingen, efter Adobes godtycke, support för programvaran baserat på
garantianspråket, utbyte av programvaran eller, om Adobe bedömer att support eller utbyte inte är
praktiskt genomförbart, återbetalning av den (eventuella) licensavgift som kunden erlagt för
programvaran. DEN BEGRÄNSADE GARANTI SOM ANGES I DETTA AVSNITT GER KUNDEN SÄRSKILDA
JURIDISKA RÄTTIGHETER. KUNDEN KAN HA YTTERLIGARE LAGSTADGADE RÄTTIGHETER SOM KAN
VARIERA MELLAN OLIKA JURISDIKTIONER. ADOBE HAR INTE FÖR AVSIKT ATT BEGRÄNSA KUNDENS
GARANTIRÄTTIGHETER PÅ NÅGOT SÄTT SOM LAGEN INTE TILLÅTER. Se avsnitt 16 för bestämmelser
avseende specifika jurisdiktioner eller kontakta Adobes kundtjänst.
7. Friskrivningsklausul.
DEN BEGRÄNSADE GARANTIN I AVSNITT 6, SAMT EVENTUELLA LAGSTADGADE GARANTIER OCH
ERSÄTTNINGAR SOM INTE FÅR UNDANTAS ELLER BEGRÄNSAS ENLIGT LAG, ÄR DE ENDA
GARANTIER OCH ERSÄTTNINGAR SOM ÄR TILLÄMPLIGA FÖR PROGRAMVARAN. UTÖVER DESSA
ERBJUDNA OCH LAGSTADGADE GARANTIER OCH ERSÄTTNINGAR AVSÄGER SIG ADOBE, DESS
NÄRSTÅENDE BOLAG, LEVERANTÖRER OCH CERTIFIKATUTFÄRDARE (DEFINIERADE NEDAN) ALLA
GARANTIER, VILLKOR, UTFÄSTELSER OCH MOTSVARANDE, UTTRYCKLIGA ELLER
UNDERFÖRSTÅDDA, I ENLIGHET MED LAG, PRAXIS, SEDVANA, HANDELSBRUK ELLER LIKNANDE I
NÅGOT SOM HELST AVSEENDE, INKLUSIVE MEN INTE BEGRÄNSAT TILL FULLGÖRANDE, SÄKERHET,
GARANTIER OM ATT VÅRA TJÄNSTER INTE GÖR INTRÅNG I TREDJE PARTS RÄTTIGHETER,
INTEGRATION, SÄLJBARHET, OSTÖRD NYTTJANDERÄTT, TILLFREDSSTÄLLANDE KVALITET ELLER
LÄMPLIGHET FÖR SPECIELLA ÄNDAMÅL. UTÖVER DESSA ERBJUDNA OCH LAGSTADGADE
GARANTIER OCH ERSÄTTNINGAR TILLHANDAHÅLLS PROGRAMVARAN OCH TILLGÅNG TILL ALLA
WEBBPLATSER, ADOBES ELLER TREDJE PARTS ONLINETJÄNSTER OCH
CERTIFIKATUTFÄRDARTJÄNSTER I BEFINTLIGT SKICK OCH MED ALLA BRISTER. DENNA
ANSVARSFRISKRIVNING KANSKE INTE ÄR GILTIG I ALLA JURISDIKTIONER. KUNDEN KAN
EVENTUELLT HA ANDRA LAGSTADGADE RÄTTIGHETER SOM INTE FÅR AVSÄGAS ELLER
EXKLUDERAS. ADOBE HAR INTE FÖR AVSIKT ATT BEGRÄNSA KUNDENS GARANTIRÄTTIGHETER PÅ
NÅGOT SÄTT SOM LAGEN INTE TILLÅTER. Bestämmelserna i avsnitt 7 och avsnitt 8 gäller även efter att
detta Avtal har upphört att gälla, oavsett orsak, men det medför inte och beviljar inte någon rätt till
fortsatt användning av programvaran efter att detta Avtal har upphört att gälla.
--- Page 425 ---
8. Ansvarsbegränsning.
FÖRUTOM DEN EXKLUSIVA ERSÄTTNING SOM ADOBE ERBJUDER OVAN OCH EVENTUELLA
ERSÄTTNINGAR SOM INTE FÅR UNDANTAS ELLER BEGRÄNSAS ENLIGT LAG SKA ADOBE, DESS
NÄRSTÅENDE BOLAG, LEVERANTÖRER OCH CERTIFIKATUTFÄRDARE UNDER INGA
OMSTÄNDIGHETER VARA ANSVARIGA GENTEMOT KUNDEN FÖR NÅGON FÖRLUST, SKADA, KRAV
ELLER KOSTNAD ÖVERHUVUDTAGET, INKLUSIVE FÖLJDSKADOR, DIREKTA ELLER INDIREKTA
SKADOR, UTEBLIVEN VINST, FÖRLORADE INTÄKTER, FÖRLUST PÅ GRUND AV
VERKSAMHETSAVBROTT, PERSONSKADA ELLER FÖRSUMMELSE ATT IAKTTA AKTSAMHET ELLER
ANSPRÅK FRÅN TREDJE PART, ÄVEN OM ADOBE ELLER DESS UNDERLEVERANTÖRER HAR BLIVIT
UNDERRÄTTADE OM RISKEN FÖR SÅDANA SKADOR, FÖRLUSTER, KRAV ELLER KOSTNADER. DET
TOTALA ANSVARET FÖR ADOBE, DESS NÄRSTÅENDE BOLAG, LEVERANTÖRER OCH
CERTIFIKATUTFÄRDARE UNDER OCH I SAMBAND MED DETTA AVTAL BEGRÄNSAS UNDER ALLA
OMSTÄNDIGHETER TILL DET BELOPP SOM BETALATS FÖR PROGRAMVARAN. DENNA BEGRÄNSNING
GÄLLER ÄVEN VID ETT GRUNDLÄGGANDE ELLER VÄSENTLIGT BROTT ELLER BROTT MOT
GRUNDLÄGGANDE ELLER VÄSENTLIGA BESTÄMMELSER I DETTA AVTAL. Inget i detta Avtal begränsar
Adobes ansvar mot kunden för dödsfall eller personskador till följd av försumlighet eller bedrägligt
beteende från Adobes sida. Adobe företräder sina närstående bolag, leverantörer och Certifikatutfärdare
avseende friskrivning, begränsning och exkludering av skyldigheter, garantier och ansvar, dock inte i
några andra avseenden eller syften.
OVANSTÅENDE BEGRÄNSNINGAR OCH EXKLUDERINGAR GÄLLER I DEN UTSTRÄCKNING TILLÄMPLIG
LAGSTIFTNING I KUNDENS JURISDIKTION TILLÅTER DETTA. DENNA BEGRÄNSNING KANSKE INTE ÄR
GILTIG I ALLA JURISDIKTIONER. KUNDEN KAN HA ANDRA RÄTTIGHETER SOM ENLIGT
KONSUMENTSKYDDSLAGAR OCH ANDRA LAGAR INTE FÅR AVSÄGAS. ADOBE HAR INTE FÖR AVSIKT
ATT BEGRÄNSA KUNDENS GARANTI ELLER ERSÄTTNINGAR PÅ NÅGOT SÄTT SOM LAGEN INTE
TILLÅTER. SE AVSNITT 16 FÖR BESTÄMMELSER AVSEENDE SPECIFIKA JURISDIKTIONER.
9. Exportregler.
Kunden medger att programvaran omfattas av USA:s exportlagstiftning (”Exportlagstiftningen”) och
bekräftar att kunden kommer att följa denna exportlagstiftning. Kunden kommer inte, vare sig direkt
eller indirekt, att exportera eller återexportera programvaran till: (a) länder som omfattas av USA:s
exportrestriktioner (inbegripet, men ej begränsat till, Kuba, Iran, Nordkorea, Sudan och Syrien), (b) en
slutanvändare som kunden vet eller har anledning att veta kommer att använda den till att utforma,
utveckla eller producera kärnvapen, kemiska vapen eller biologiska vapen, eller raketsystem,
uppskjutningsfordon eller raketsonder, eller obemannade flygsystem, eller (c) en slutanvändare som har
förbjudits att delta i USA:s exporttransaktioner av en federal myndighet inom USA:s förvaltning.
Dessutom ansvarar kunden för att följa sådan lokal lagstiftning i kundens jurisdiktion som kan påverka
kundens rätt att importera, exportera eller använda programvaran. Om Adobe får vetskap om att en
överträdelse har ägt rum, kan Adobe vara förbjudet att tillhandahålla underhåll och support avseende
programvaran.
10. Tillämplig lag.
Om kunden är en konsument som endast använder programvaran för personligt, icke-kommersiellt
bruk är detta Avtal underkastat lagstiftningen i den jurisdiktion där kunden köpte licensen för att få
använda programvaran. Om kunden inte är en sådan konsument lyder detta Avtal under och tolkas i
enlighet med tillämplig lagstiftning i: (a) delstaten Kalifornien, om en licens för programvaran gäller en
kund i USA, Kanada eller Mexiko, (b) Japan, om en licens för programvaran gäller en kund i Japan,
(c) Singapore, om en licens för programvaran gäller en kund i en medlemsstat i ASEAN-länderna
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Folkrepubliken Kina Hongkong SAR, Macao SAR, Taiwan eller
Republiken Korea, eller (d) England och Wales, om en licens för programvaran gäller en kund i en
jurisdiktion som inte omnämns ovan. Domstolen i Santa Clara County, Kalifornien, vid tillämpning av
--- Page 426 ---
kalifornisk lag, distriktsdomstolen i Tokyo, Japan, vid tillämpning av japansk lag respektive behöriga
domstolar i London, England, vid tillämpning av engelsk och walesisk lag, ska var och en ha icke-
exklusiv jurisdiktion över tvister avseende detta avtal. Vid tillämpning av singaporiansk lag ska alla
tvister som uppstår i samband med detta avtal, inklusive frågor gällande dess befintlighet, giltighet eller
upphörande, hänvisas till och slutgiltigt lösas via skiljedomsförfarande i Singapore i enlighet med de då
gällande skiljedomsreglerna vid Singapore International Arbitration Centre (”SIAC”). Dessa regler
införlivas härmed i detta avsnitt via hänvisning. Det ska finnas en skiljedomare som utses gemensamt av
parterna. Om skiljedomaren inte utses inom trettio (30) dagar från skriftlig begäran om
skiljedomsförfarande av den ena parten ska SIAC:s ordförande utse en skiljedomare. Språket för
skiljedomsförfarandet ska vara engelska. Oavsett vad som anges i bestämmelserna i detta avtal har
Adobe och kunden rätt att begära att en juridisk, administrativ eller annan myndighet föreskriver
interimistiska åtgärder eller skyddsåtgärder, inklusive förbudsförelägganden, krav på fullgörande eller
andra lämpliga åtgärder, innan rättsliga förfaranden eller skiljedomsförfaranden inleds, eller medan
sådana förfaranden pågår, i syfte att skydda sina rättigheter och intressen eller upprätthålla särskilda
villkor som lämpar sig för interimistiska lösningar. Detta avtal ska inte vara underkastat följande, vars
tillämpningar härmed uttryckligen undantas: (x) lagvalsregler inom den internationella privaträtten,
(y) Förenta Nationernas konvention angående avtal om internationella köp av varor eller (z) Uniform
Computer Information Transactions Act (den enhetliga lagen om datorinformationstransaktioner), så
som det införlivats i någon jurisdiktions lagstiftning.
11. Allmänna bestämmelser.
Om någon del av detta avtal förklaras ogiltig och icke verkställbar ska det inte påverka giltigheten av
detta avtal i övrigt, vilket ska förbli giltigt och verkställbart enligt dess villkor. Ändringar i detta avtal får
endast ske skriftligen och måste undertecknas av behörig ställföreträdare för Adobe. Den engelska
versionen av detta avtal ska vara den version som används vid tolkningen av detta avtal. Detta avtal
utgör det enda avtalet mellan Adobe och kunden såvitt avser programvaran och det ersätter alla
tidigare utfästelser, diskussioner, åtaganden, meddelanden eller tillkännagivanden med anknytning till
programvaran.
12. Meddelande till slutanvändare inom amerikansk förvaltning.
12.1 Licenser för Adobe-teknologi inom amerikansk förvaltning. Kunden accepterar att när Adobes
programvara licensieras för förvärv av amerikansk förvaltning, eller någon uppdragstagare därför,
beviljas kundens licens i enlighet med riktlinjerna i 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 12.212 (för civila myndigheter)
och 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 227.7202-1 och 227.7202-4 (för försvarsdepartementet). Avseende slutanvändare
inom amerikansk förvaltning går Adobe med på att följa alla tillämpliga lagar gällande lika rättigheter,
inklusive, om så är tillämpligt, bestämmelserna i Executive Order 11246, inklusive ändringar,
paragraf 402 i Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act från 1974 (38 USC 4212) och
paragraf 503 i Rehabilitation Act från 1973, inklusive ändringar, och föreskrifterna i 41 CFR del 60-1
t.o.m. 60-60, 60-250 och 60-741. Klausulen om positiv särbehandling och föreskrifterna i föregående
mening införlivas i detta avtal via hänvisning.
12.2 Kommersiella produkter. Avseende slutanvändare inom amerikansk förvaltning utgör
programvaran ”Commercial Item(s)”, såsom detta begrepp definieras i 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 2.101, bestående
av ”Commercial Computer Software” och ”Commercial Computer Software Documentation” såsom
dessa begrepp används i 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 227.7202, allt efter vad som är
tillämpligt. I enlighet med 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 12.212 eller 48 C.F.R. avsnitt 227.7202-1 t.o.m. 227.7202–4,
allt efter vad som är tillämpligt, licensieras ”Commercial Computer Software” och ”Commercial
Computer Software Documentation” till slutanvändare inom amerikansk förvaltning (a) enbart som
”Commercial Items” och (b) endast med de rättigheter som gäller för alla andra slutanvändare i enlighet
med villkoren i detta avtal. Opublicerade rättigheter under amerikansk upphovsrättslag förbehålles.
--- Page 427 ---
13. Överensstämmelse med licenser.
Om kunden är ett företag eller en organisation samtycker kunden till att Adobe eller dess auktoriserade
representant, utöver de licenskontroller som utförs automatiskt av programvaran, har rätt att inspektera
kundens register, system och lokaler, högst en gång var tolfte (12:e) månad och med sju (7) dagars
varsel, för att kontrollera att kundens användning av alla Adobe-program eller -tjänster sker i enlighet
med giltiga licenser från Adobe. Adobe har exempelvis rätt att få tillgång till de av kundens register som
kan vara till nytta för att fastställa huruvida installationer av programvaran har, eller inte har,
serienummeranknutits, och kunden måste tillställa Adobe sådana register omgående på Adobes
begäran. Dessutom ska kunden förse Adobe med alla underlag och all information som Adobe ber om i
syfte att kontrollera att kundens användning av Adobes programvara uppfyller kraven i kundens giltiga
licenser från Adobe inom trettio (30) dagar från Adobes begäran. Ytterligare information om
serienummeranknytning finns på http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_se.
14. Internet-anslutning och sekretess.
14.1 Automatisk Internet-anslutning. Programvaran kan göra att kundens dator utan föregående
meddelande automatiskt ansluter till Internet och kommunicerar med en Adobe-webbplats eller
Adobe-domän i syften som licensvalidering och för att förse kunden med ytterligare information,
egenskaper och funktioner. Om inte annat framgår av avsnitt 14.2 till och med 14.7 gäller följande
bestämmelser för programvarans alla automatiska Internet-anslutningar:
14.1.1 Varje gång programvaran ansluter till Internet och kommunicerar med en Adobe-webbplats
gäller Adobes Integritetspolicy, oavsett om detta sker automatiskt eller på grund av en uttrycklig
begäran från användaren. Adobes Integritetspolicy tillåter spårning av webbplatsbesök och innehåller
detaljerad information om spårning samt användningen av cookies, webbsignaler och liknande
tekniker.
14.1.2 Varje gång programvaran ansluter till Adobe via Internet samlas viss information om kunden in
och överförs av programvaran till Adobe i enlighet med Adobes online-integritetspolicy, som finns att
läsa på http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_se (”Integritetspolicy”).
14.1.3 Om kunden ansluter till en Adobe-onlinetjänst (enligt definitionen i avsnitt 16.4 nedan) eller
aktiverar eller registrerar programvaran kan ytterligare information, t.ex. kundens Adobe-ID,
användarnamn och lösenord, överföras till och lagras av Adobe i enlighet med Adobes Integritetspolicy
och ytterligare villkor för användning som rör den aktuella Adobe-onlinetjänsten (där Adobe.coms
villkor för användning och eventuellt tillämpliga villkor gemensamt kallas ”Ytterligare villkor för
användning”).
14.1.4 I enlighet med det som tillämplig lagstiftning tillåter eller efter kundens medgivande får Adobe
(a) skicka transaktionsmeddelanden från kunden för att underlätta Adobes onlinetjänst eller
aktiveringen eller registreringen av programvaran eller Adobes onlinetjänst, eller (b) leverera
marknadsföring inom produkten för att tillhandahålla information om programvaran och andra Adobe-
produkter och -tjänster genom att använda information, inklusive men inte begränsat till
plattformsversion, version av programvaran, licensstatus och språk.
14.2 Uppdatering. Programvaran kan göra att kundens dator utan föregående meddelande automatiskt
ansluter till Internet (intermittent eller regelbundet) för att (a) leta efter Uppdateringar som finns
tillgängliga för nedladdning till och installation på datorn och för att (b) meddela Adobe resultaten av
installationsförsök.
14.3 Aktivering. Programvaran kan kräva att kunden (a) skaffar ett Adobe-ID, (b) aktiverar eller
återaktiverar programvaran, (c) registrerar programvaran eller (d) validerar sitt medlemskap. Dessa krav
kan göra att kundens dator ansluter till Internet utan föregående varning vid installation, vid start och
med jämna mellanrum därefter. Efter anslutning kommer programvaran att samla in och överföra
information till Adobe i enlighet med beskrivningen på http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_se
--- Page 428 ---
(”Villkor för aktivering”). Programvaran eller kunden kan också komma att ta emot information från
Adobe som rör kundens licens, prenumeration eller medlemskap. Adobe kan använda sådan
information för att upptäcka eller förebygga bedräglig eller otillåten användning som strider mot
villkoren för en giltig licens eller prenumeration eller ett giltigt medlemskap. Underlåtenhet att aktivera
eller registrera programvaran, validera en prenumeration eller ett medlemskap, eller ett fastställande
från Adobes sida att programvaran används på ett bedrägligt eller otillåtet sätt, kan leda till nedsatt
funktionalitet, icke-fungerande programvara eller till uppsägning eller frysning av prenumerationen eller
medlemskapet.
14.4 Avaktivering. Kunden får avaktivera och avinstallera programvaran från sin dator för att kunna
installera och aktivera programvaran på en annan dator i enlighet med detta avtal (”Avaktivering”) och
enligt beskrivningen i http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_se. Avaktivering kräver anslutning till
Internet.
14.5 Användning av onlinetjänster. Programvaran kan göra att kundens dator automatiskt, utan
föregående meddelande, intermittent eller regelbundet, ansluter till Internet för att underlätta kundens
tillgång till innehåll och tjänster som Adobe eller tredje parter tillhandahåller i enlighet med avsnitt 16.4
(Onlinetjänster). Därutöver kan programvaran eventuellt också utan föregående meddelande
automatiskt ansluta till Internet för att uppdatera nedladdningsbart material från dessa onlinetjänster så
att tjänsterna omedelbart blir tillgängliga även när kunden inte är uppkopplad.
14.6 Digitala certifikat. Programvaran använder digitala certifikat (enligt beskrivningen i avsnitt 16.5) för
att hjälpa kunden att identifiera nedladdade filer (exempelvis program och innehåll) och vem som
publicerat dessa filer. Till exempel använder Adobe AIR digitala certifikat för att hjälpa kunden att
identifiera vem som publicerat Adobe AIR-program. Produktfamiljen Adobe Acrobat använder även
digitala certifikat för att signera och verifiera signaturer i PDF-dokument samt för att verifiera certifierade
PDF-dokument. Kundens dator kan ansluta till Internet när det digitala certifikatet ska verifieras.
14.7 Inställningshanteraren. Programvaran kan innefatta Flash Player. Flash Player kan göra att vissa
användarinställningar lagras på kundens dator som ett lokalt delat objekt. Dessa är kopplade till den
instans av Flash Player som finns på datorn, vilket möjliggör för kunden att anpassa
körningsegenskaper. Med Inställningshanteraren i Flash Player kan kunden ändra denna typ av
inställningar, t.ex. möjligheten att begränsa tredje parters lagring av lokalt delade objekt eller bevilja
innehåll från tredje part åtkomsträttighet till datorns mikrofon och kamera. Mer information om hur du
konfigurerar inställningarna i programvarans version av Flash Player, bl.a. information om hur du
avaktiverar lokalt delade objekt via Inställningshanteraren, finns på
http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_se. Mer information om lokalt delade objekt finns på
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_se.
15. Peer-to-peer-kommunikation.
Programvaran kan eventuellt, utan föregående meddelande, använda kundens anslutning till ett lokalt
nätverk, för att automatiskt ansluta till annan Adobe-programvara och kan, när så sker, indikera över
det lokala nätverket att den är tillgänglig för kommunikation med annan Adobe-programvara. Vid
sådana anslutningar kan IP-adressen för kundens anslutning överföras till det lokala nätverket.
16. Specifika bestämmelser och undantag.
Detta avsnitt behandlar specifika bestämmelser relaterade till vissa produkter och komponenter i
programvaran liksom begränsade undantag från de ovan beskrivna villkoren. I det fall en bestämmelse i
detta avsnitt strider mot något annat villkor i detta avtal ska de villkor som redovisas i detta avsnitt gälla
framför ett sådant villkor.
16.1 Utan förfång; bestämmelser för Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet; obligatoriskt
meddelande för Australien.
--- Page 429 ---
16.1.1 Avtalet ska inte begränsa de lagstadgade rättigheter som tillkommer en part, inklusive parter som
handlar i egenskap av konsument. Exempelvis gäller för konsumenter i Nya Zeeland som anskaffar
programvaran för personligt bruk, privat bruk eller hemmabruk (ej i affärssyfte) att detta avtal är
underkastat Consumer Guarantees Act.
16.1.2 Om kunden anskaffat programvaran inom Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet (EES),
kunden normalt uppehåller sig i EES-området och är konsument (det vill säga att programvaran
används för personligt, ej affärsrelaterat bruk), så gäller inte avsnitt 6 (Begränsad garanti) för kundens
anskaffande och bruk av programvaran. I stället garanterar Adobe under en period på två år från
inköpsdatumet att programvaran tillhandahåller de funktioner som anges i tillämplig användarhandbok
(de ”överenskomna funktionerna”) vid användning på en kompatibel dator. Icke-väsentliga avvikelser
från de överenskomna funktionerna innebär inte någon garantirätt. DENNA GARANTI GÄLLER INTE
FÖR PROGRAMVARA SOM KUNDEN ANVÄNDER PÅ FÖRHANDS-, TEST-, START- ELLER
PRODUKTPROVSBASIS, ELLER FÖR TECKENSNITTSPROGRAMVARA ELLER I DEN UTSTRÄCKNING
SOM PROGRAMVARAN INTE FUNGERAR PÅ AVSETT SÄTT DÄRFÖR ATT DEN HAR ÄNDRATS AV
KUNDEN. Vid framställan av ett garantianspråk måste kunden underrätta Adobes kundtjänst under
denna tvåårsperiod, med inköpsbevis avseende förvärv av programvaran. Adobe kommer att bekräfta
för kunden om det föreligger någon defekt i programvaran, eller meddela kunden att felet uppkommer
till följd av att kunden inte har installerat programvaran på korrekt sätt (och Adobe kommer i så fall att
hjälpa kunden). Om det föreligger en defekt i programvaran får kunden av Adobe begära antingen en
återbetalning eller ett reparerat eller nytt exemplar av programvaran. Anspråk måste åtföljas av
inköpsbevis. Om kundens garantianspråk bekräftas kommer Adobe att uppfylla kundens begäran om
reparerad eller ny programvara, såvida det inte är oskäligt för Adobe att göra detta, varvid Adobe i så
fall kommer att bevilja kunden en återbetalning. Kontakta Adobes kundtjänst för ytterligare information
om garantin.
Observera att bestämmelserna i avsnitt 8 (Ansvarsbegränsning) fortsätter att gälla för eventuella
skadeståndsanspråk som kunden framställer med avseende på användning av programvaran. Oavsett
detta ansvarar Adobe för direkta förluster som är skäligen förutsebara för den händelse Adobe bryter
mot detta avtal. Kunden bör vidta alla skäliga åtgärder för att undvika och begränsa skador, i synnerhet
genom att säkerhetskopiera programvaran och data.
Detta avtal, och i synnerhet detta avsnitt 16.1.2, är avsett att redogöra för kundens rättigheter (inklusive
lagstadgade rättigheter) ifall problem skulle uppstå i samband med kundens användning av
programvaran. Om kundens lagstadgade rättigheter är mer omfattande än de rättigheter som redovisas
häri så gäller kundens lagstadgade rättigheter.
16.1.3 Ingenting i detta avtal (inklusive avsnitt 4.4) är avsett att begränsa någon icke-avsägbar rätt att
dekompilera programvaran som kunden enligt gällande lag eventuellt kan ha. Om kunden exempelvis
befinner sig i Europeiska unionen (EU) har kunden, under vissa villkor som framgår av gällande lag, rätt
att dekompilera programvaran, om detta är nödvändigt för att åstadkomma samkörbarhet mellan
programvaran och annan programvara, och kunden först skriftligen har bett Adobe att tillhandahålla
den information som krävs för att kunna åstadkomma sådan samkörbarhet och Adobe inte har gjort
sådan information tillgänglig. Dessutom får sådan dekompilering endast utföras av kunden eller av
någon annan som har rätt att använda ett exemplar av programvaran för kundens räkning. Adobe har
rätt att ålägga rimliga villkor före tillhandahållandet av sådan information. Eventuell information som
tillhandahålls av Adobe eller som införskaffas av kunden i enlighet med vad som medges enligt detta
avtal, får endast användas av kunden för det syfte som framgår häri och får inte avslöjas för tredje part
eller användas för att skapa en programvara som i allt väsentligt liknar programvarans framställning
eller som används till något annat som gör intrång i Adobes eller dess licensgivares upphovsrätt.
16.1.4 Om kunden erhåller programvaran i Australien gäller följande villkor, oavsett om något i avtalet
motsäger detta:
--- Page 430 ---
MEDDELANDE TILL KUNDER I AUSTRALIEN:
Med våra varor följer en garanti som inte kan exkluderas enligt australiensisk konsumentlagstiftning. Du
har rätt till en ersättning eller återbetalning vid allvarliga fel samt kompensation för eventuella övriga
rimligen förutsebara förluster eller skador. Du har även rätt att få varorna reparerade eller ersatta om
varorna inte är av godtagbar kvalitet och felet inte är ett allvarligt fel. Programvaran har även en
begränsad licens på 90 dagar från Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, med huvudkontor på
4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Irland, i enlighet med avtalet. Om produkten inte
tillhandahåller de allmänna funktioner och egenskaper som beskrivs i användardokumentationen under
90-dagarsperioden efter att den har levererats till dig kan du kontakta Adobes kundtjänst på
1800 614 863 och ange uppgifter om produkten, serienummer och inköpsbevis. Du kanske måste
returnera programvaran till den adress vi ger dig och returneringen sker i så fall på din bekostnad.
Förmånerna enligt den här garantin gäller utöver andra rättigheter och ersättningar du får enligt
lagstiftning.
16.2 Ytterligare villkor för Förhandsversioner av programvara. Om programvaran är en förhandsversion
eller betaprogramvara (”Förhandsversion”) gäller detta avsnitt. Förhandsversionen av programvaran
utgör inte en slutlig produkt från Adobe och kan innehålla fel och andra problem som kan orsaka
systemfel eller andra fel samt dataförlust. Adobe ger eventuellt aldrig ut Förhandsversionens
programvara kommersiellt. Om kunden har mottagit Förhandsversionen i enlighet med ett separat
skriftligt avtal, exempelvis Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for PreRelease Software,
underkastas även kundens användning av programvaran detta avtal. Kunden ska omgående returnera
eller förstöra alla exemplar av Förhandsversionen när Adobe begär detta eller när Adobe kommersiellt
ger ut sådan programvara, om detta sker först. KUNDENS ANVÄNDNING AV FÖRHANDSVERSIONER AV
PROGRAMVARAN SKER PÅ EGEN RISK. SE AVSNITT 6 OCH 8 FÖR INFORMATION OM BEGRÄNSAD
GARANTI OCH ANSVARSBEGRÄNSNINGAR SOM GÄLLER FÖR FÖRHANDSVERSIONER AV
PROGRAMVARA.
16.3 Utbildningsprogramvara. Om programvaran är en utbildningsprogramvara (programvara tillverkad
och distribuerad endast för användning av utbildningsslutanvändare) har kunden inte rätt att använda
programvaran om kunden inte uppfyller kraven för utbildningsslutanvändare i sin jurisdiktion.
Information om kvalificeringskraven finns på http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_se. På
http://www.adobe.com/go/store_se finns en länk för att köpa Adobe-produkter runt hela världen.

16.4 Onlinetjänster.
16.4.1 Tillhandahållna av Adobe. Programvaran underlättar kundens åtkomst till innehåll och olika
tjänster som finns på webbplatser som drivs av Adobe eller dess närstående bolag (”Adobes
onlinetjänster”). Exempel på Adobes onlinetjänster kan vara, men är inte begränsat till: Adobe
BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, Business Catalyst, Digital Publishing Suite, Acrobat.com, Search for Help
och välkomstskärmar för produkter. I vissa fall kan en Adobe-onlinetjänst uppträda som en funktion
eller ett tillägg inom programvaran trots att den ligger på en webbplats. Åtkomst till en Adobe-
onlinetjänst kan kräva att kunden aktiverar programvaran, skaffar ett Adobe-ID, accepterar Ytterligare
villkor för användning, eller så kan en separat avgift krävas för åtkomst till sådana Adobe-onlinetjänster.
Adobes onlinetjänster finns eventuellt inte tillgängliga på alla språk eller för personer i alla länder, och
Adobe äger rätt att när som helst och oavsett orsak modifiera eller avbryta tillgängligheten för en
Adobe-onlinetjänst. Adobe förbehåller sig även rätten att börja ta ut en avgift för åtkomst till eller
användning av en Adobe-onlinetjänst som tidigare tillhandahållits avgiftsfritt. I avsnitt 14 redovisas
viktig information om Internet-anslutning och kundens integritet. När programvaran ansluter till en
Adobe-onlinetjänst styrs kundens användning av sagda Adobe-onlinetjänst, enligt avsnitt 14, av Adobes
Integritetspolicy (http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_se), av Adobe.coms villkor för användning
(http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_se) och av eventuella ytterligare användningsvillkor som kan
föreläggas kunden vid anslutningstillfället.

som drivs av tredje parter som erbjuder varor, information, programvara och tjänster
(”Tredjepartsonlinetjänster”). Exempel på sådana Tredjepartsonlinetjänster kan vara, men är inte
begränsat till, tjänsten Kodak EasyShare Gallery. Kundens åtkomst till och användning av
Tredjepartsonlinetjänster styrs av de villkor, bestämmelser, friskrivningar och meddelanden som finns
på en sådan webbplats eller som på annat sätt är knutna till sådana Tredjepartsonlinetjänster. Adobe
varken kontrollerar, stödjer eller accepterar ansvar för Tredjepartsonlinetjänster. Alla mellanhavanden
mellan kunden och tredje part i samband med en Tredjepartsonlinetjänst, inklusive sådan parts
integritetspolicy och användning av kundens personliga information, leverans och betalning av varor
och tjänster samt andra villkor, bestämmelser, garantier eller utfästelser kopplade till sådana
mellanhavanden, sker helt och hållet mellan kunden och sådan tredje part. Tredjepartsonlinetjänster
finns eventuellt inte tillgängliga på alla språk eller för personer i alla länder, och Adobe äger rätt att när
som helst och oavsett orsak modifiera eller ändra tillgängligheten för en Tredjepartsonlinetjänst.

Yazılım ayrıntılı olarak http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_tr adresinde tarif edildiği şekilde bilgi
toplayacak ve bunu Adobe’ye iletecektir (“Etkinleştirme Koşulları”). Yazılım ya da Müşteri Müşterinin
lisansı, aboneliği ya da Üyeliği ile ilgili olarak Adobe’den bilgi alabilir. Adobe söz konusu bilgileri geçerli
bir lisans, abonelik ya da Üyelik ile uygunluk içerisinde olmayan hileli ya da yetkisiz kullanımı tespit ya
da bertaraf etmek için kullanabilir. Yazılımı etkinleştirmek ya da kaydetmek, abonelik ya da Üyeliği
doğrulamaktaki temerrüt ya da Yazılımın hileli ya da yetkisiz kullanımının Adobe tarafından tespiti
Yazılımın azaltmış işlevsellik, işletilememesi ile ya da abonelik ya da Üyeliğin feshi ya da ertelenmesi ile
sonuçlanabilir.
14.4 Devre Dışı Bırakma. Müşteri, Yazılımı işbu anlaşmaya (“Devre dışı Bırakma”) uygun olarak ve

adresini yerel ağa iletebilir.
16. Özel Hükümler ve İstisnalar.
İşbu bölüm Yazılımın bazı ürün ve bileşenleri ile ilgili özel hükümler ve de yukarıdaki hüküm ve
koşullara ilişkin bazı istisnalara yer vermektedir. İşbu bölümde ifade edilen koşullar, işbu bölümdeki
herhangi bir hükmün işbu anlaşmadaki herhangi bir koşul ya da şart ile çelişki halinde olduğu ölçüde
söz konusu koşul ya da şartı ilga eder.
16.1 Tarafların Haklarına Halel Getirmeme; Avrupa Ekonomik Alanı Hükümleri; Avustralya Zorunlu
Bildirimi.
16.1.1 İşbu anlaşma, tüketici sıfatıyla hareket edenler dahil olmak üzere taraflardan herhangi birinin
yasal haklarına halel getirmeyecektir. Örnek vermek gerekirse, Yeni Zelanda’da ikamet edip de Yazılımı
kişisel, ev ile ilgili ya da ev idaresine ilişkin kullanım (ticari olmayan amaçlarla) için satın alan tüketiciler
için işbu anlaşma Tüketici Garantileri Yasasına tabidir.
16.1.2 Müşteri Yazılımı Avrupa Ekonomik Alanında (EEA) edindiyse, genellikle EEA’da ikamet ediyorsa
ve bir tüketiciyse (Yazılımı kişisel ve ticari olmayan amaçlarla kullanıyorsa), o zaman Bölüm 6 Müşterinin
Yazılımı satın alma ve kullanımına uygulanmaz. Bunun yerine Adobe, Yazılımın satın alınmasını
müteakip 2 yıl boyunca Yazılımın önerilen donanım yapılandırmasında kullanılması koşuluyla ilgili
kullanıcı kılavuzunda (“üzerinde mutabık kalınan işlevler”) öngörülen işlevleri karşılayacağını garanti
eder. Üzerinde mutabık kalınan işlevlerden önemsiz sapmalar, herhangi bir garanti hakkı
doğurmayacaktır. İŞBU GARANTİ; MÜŞTERİNİN ÖN SÜRÜM, DENEME, BAŞLANGIÇ VEYA ÜRÜN
ÖRNEĞİ OLARAK KULLANDIĞI YAZILIMLAR VEYA YAZI TİPİ YAZILIMLARI İÇİN YA DA YAZILIMIN
MÜŞTERİ TARAFINDAN DEĞİŞTİRİLMESİ SONUCU ÇALIŞMAMASI DURUMUNDA UYGULANMAZ.
Müşteri bir garanti talebinde bulunabilmek için işbu 2 yıllık dönemde Adobe Müşteri Destek
Departmanına Yazılımın satın alma belgelerine ilişkin ayrıntıları vermek suretiyle bildirimde
bulunmalıdır. Adobe, Yazılımda bir kusur olup olmadığını Müşteri ile birlikte araştıracak veya hatanın
Müşterinin Yazılımı doğru yüklememiş olmasından kaynaklandığı (ki bu durumda Adobe Müşteriye
yardımcı olacaktır) konusunda Müşteriyi haberdar edecektir. Yazılımda kusur varsa, Müşteri Adobe’den
ücret iadesi ya da Yazılımın onarılmış bir kopyasını ya da başka bir kopyayla değiştirilmesini talep
edebilir. Tüm taleplerin beraberinde satın alma kanıtı da yer almalıdır. Müşterinin garanti bilgilerinin
doğrulanması halinde ve bu yönde hareket etmenin Adobe açısından uygunsuz olmaması şartıyla,
Adobe Müşterinin Yazılımı onarma veya değiştirme talebini yerine getirecektir ve bu şekilde hareket
--- Page 446 ---
etmenin Adobe açısından uygunsuz olması durumunda ise, Adobe Müşteriye iade ödemesi yapacaktır.
Garanti konusunda yardım için lütfen Adobe Müşteri Destek Departmanı ile iletişime geçin.
Lütfen Bölüm 8’in hükümlerinin (Sorumluluğun Sınırlandırılması) Müşterinin Yazılımı kullanımına
istinaden yaptığı zarar taleplerine uygulanmaya devam edeceğini göz önünde bulundurun. Bununla
birlikte, Adobe işbu anlaşmanın Adobe tarafından ihlali halinde makul bir şekilde öngörülebilir
doğrudan zararlardan sorumlu olacaktır. Müşterinin, hasarları önlemek ve azaltmak için özellikle de
Yazılım veya bilgisayar verilerinin yedek kopyalarını oluşturmak suretiyle tüm makul tedbirleri alması
tavsiye edilir.
İşbu anlaşma ve özellikle işbu Bölüm 16.1.2 Yazılım kullanım ile ilgili sorunlar olması halinde, Müşterinin
haklarını (yasal hakları dahil) tanımlamayı hedeflemektedir. Müşterinin yasal haklarının burada
tanımlananlardan daha üstün olması halinde yasal haklar uygulanacaktır.
16.1.3 İşbu anlaşmadaki hiçbir husus (Bölüm 4.4 dahil), Müşterinin geçerli mevzuat uyarınca mevcut
olan Yazılımı kaynak koduna dönüştürmeye yönelik feragat edilemez hakkını sınırlandıramaz. Örnek
vermek gerekirse, Müşteri Avrupa Birliği’nde (AB) ikamet ediyorsa, Yazılımın başka bir yazılım programı
ile birlikte çalışabilmesini sağlamak üzere gerekli olması ve söz konusu işlerliğe erişmek üzere
Müşterinin söz konusu çalışabilirliği sağlamak için gerekli bilgileri temin etmesi için Adobe’den önceden
yazılı olarak talepte bulunmuş olması ve Adobe söz konusu bilgileri sunmaması halinde, Müşteri geçerli
mevzuatta belirtilen bazı koşullar sayesinde, Yazılımı kaynak koduna dönüştürme hakkına sahip olabilir.
Bundan başka, söz konusu kaynak koda dönüştürme işlemi yalnızca Müşteri tarafından ya da Müşteri
adına Yazılımın bir kopyasını kullanma hakkına sahip başka bir kişi tarafından gerçekleştirilebilir. Adobe
söz konusu bilgileri temin etmeden önce makul şartlar uygulama hakkına sahiptir. İşbu vesileyle izin
verildiği gibi Adobe tarafından tedarik ya da Müşteri tarafından elde edilen bilgiler Müşteri tarafından
sadece işbu belgede tanımlanan amaçlar için kullanılabilir ve üçüncü bir tarafa ifşa edilemez ya da
Yazılımın ifadesine esas itibariyle benzeyen bir yazılım oluşturmak üzere kullanılamaz ya da Adobe veya
lisans verenlerinin telif hakkına tecavüz eden sair herhangi bir eylem için kullanılamaz.
16.1.4 Müşteri Yazılımı Avustralya’da edinirse, o zaman işbu Sözleşmede aksine ifade edilen herhangi bir
hükme bakılmaksızın aşağıdaki hüküm uygulanır:
AVUSTRALYA’DAKİ TÜKETİCİLERE BİLDİRİM:
Ürünlerimiz Avustralya Tüketici Kanunu uyarınca hariç tutulamayan garantilere sahiptir. Esaslı arıza
halinde değiştirme ya da iade hakkına ve makul bir biçimde öngörülebilir sair kayıp ya da hasar için

Destek Bölümünü arayın. Söz konusu iadeye ilişkin masraflar tarafınıza ait olacak şekilde Yazılım
ürününü Size belirttiğimiz adrese iade etmeniz gerekebilir. İşbu garanti çerçevesindeki menfaatler kanun
gereği sahip olabileceğiniz sair haklar ve çözüm yollarına ek olarak mevcuttur.
16.2 ÖnSürüm Yazılım için Ek Koşullar. Yazılım piyasaya sürülmeden önceki bir sürüm veya beta sürümü
ise (“Önsürüm Yazılımı”), o zaman işbu bölüm uygulanır. Önsürüm Yazılımı bir önsürüm olup nihai
Adobe ürünü anlamına gelmemektedir ve hata, kusur ve sistem ya da sair bozukluklar ve veri kaybına
sebep olabilecek sair sorunları içerebilir. Adobe, Önsürüm Yazılımlarını kesinlikle ticari amaçla piyasaya
sürmez. Müşteri Önsürüm Yazılımını Önsürüm Yazılımı için Adobe Systems Incorporated Lisans
Anlaşması gibi münferit bir yazılı sözleşmeye istinaden edinmişse, o zaman Müşterinin Yazılımı kullanımı
da söz konusu anlaşmaya tabidir. Müşteri, Adobe’nin önceden talebi ya da söz konusu Yazılımı piyasaya
sürmesi halinde, Önsürüm Yazılımının tüm kopyalarını derhal iade ya da imha etmelidir. ÖNSÜRÜM
YAZILIMINI KULLANIMI İLE İLGİLİ TÜM RİZİKOLAR MÜŞTERİYE AİTTİR. ÖNSÜRÜM YAZILIMLARIYLA
İLGİLİ GARANTİ VE SORUMLULUK SINIRLAMALARI İÇİN BÖLÜM 6 VE BÖLÜM 8’E BAKIN.

портативному Комп’ютері або на Комп’ютері, що знаходиться у нього вдома, за умови, що
Програмне забезпечення на портативному або домашньому Комп’ютері не використовується
одночасно з Програмним забезпеченням на первинному Комп’ютері.
2.1.4 Обмеження на використання другої копії програмного забезпечення власниками
корпоративної ліцензії. Якщо власник ліцензії отримав Програмне забезпечення від компанії
Adobe за програмою або угодою корпоративного ліцензування (як то Adobe Volume Licensing), за
винятком корпоративної ліцензії на навчальну версію програмного забезпечення, друга копія
Програмного забезпечення, створена згідно з умовами розділу 2.1.3, повинна використовуватися
виключно на користь та для забезпечення діяльності такого корпоративного ліцензіата.
2.1.5 Платформа з подвійним завантаженням. Програмне забезпечення ліцензується для
використання на платформі з певною операційною системою. Для використання Програмного
забезпечення на кожній із платформ з операційною системою Клієнт повинен придбати окрему
ліцензію. Наприклад, щоб встановити Програмне забезпечення на кожній із платформ з
операційними системами Mac OS та Windows на пристрої, який працює з обома цими
платформами (тобто на комп’ютері з подвійним завантаженням), Клієнт повинен спершу
отримати дві окремі ліцензії на Програмне забезпечення. Це правило застосовується навіть у
випадку, якщо дві версії Програмного забезпечення, кожна з яких призначена для окремої
платформи з операційною системою, постачаються на одному й тому ж носії.

2.1.6 Розповсюдження із сервера. Згідно з дозволом, наданим у Документації, Клієнт має
можливість скопіювати образ Програмного забезпечення на файловий сервер в межах
Внутрішньої мережі («Сервер») з метою завантаження та встановлення Програмного
забезпечення на Комп’ютери в межах тієї самої Внутрішньої мережі для використання у
відповідності до дозволів, наданих у розділі 2.
2.1.7 Використання на Сервері.
2.1.7.1 Згідно з дозволами, наданими в окремому документі на придбання або в Документації та у
відповідності до ліцензійних обмежень, встановлених цією Угодою, Клієнт має можливість
встановити Програмне забезпечення на Сервер лише з метою надання можливості користувачам
окремих Комп’ютерів, що належать до Внутрішньої мережі («Користувачі мережі»), отримати
доступ та використовувати Програмне забезпечення. Користувач мережі, який має доступ до
такого Програмного забезпечення на Сервері у подальшому іменується як «Користувач
Програмного забезпечення на Сервері». Сумарна кількість Користувачів програмного
забезпечення на Сервері (не кількість одночасно працюючих користувачів) не може
перевищувати Дозволену кількість. Наприклад, якщо Клієнт придбав 10 ліцензій на Програмне
забезпечення (Дозволена кількість складає 10), і, за вибором Клієнта, Програмне забезпечення
встановлено на Сервері, то він може дозволити не більше ніж 10 Користувачам програмного
забезпечення на Сервері отримати доступ до цього Програмного забезпечення (навіть якщо у
Клієнта більше ніж 10 Користувачів програмного забезпечення на Сервері або менше ніж 10
Користувачів мережі одночасно користуються Програмним забезпеченням).
2.1.7.2 З метою пояснення та без обмежень слід зауважити, що вищезазначене не дозволяє
Клієнту встановлювати чи надавати доступ до Програмного забезпечення (прямо або через
команди, дані чи інструкції): (а) методом взаємодії з Комп’ютером, що не входить до Внутрішньої
мережі Клієнта, (б) для активації мережевих робочих груп або мережевих служб, які мають
відкритий доступ, (в) фізичним або юридичним особам для використання, завантаження,
копіювання або отримання вигоди від функціональних можливостей Програмного забезпечення
іншим чином, якщо компанія Adobe не надала відповідного дозволу у ліцензії, (г) як компонент
системи, технологічного процесу або послуги, яка надається з перевищенням Дозволеної
кількості користувачів, або (д) для операцій, які не ініційовані окремим користувачем (наприклад,
автоматична обробка сервером).
2.2 Членство. Даний розділ 2.2 застосовується до Клієнтів, які придбали ліцензію на базі членства
або послуги, як то членство у Creative Cloud (разом — «Членство»).
2.2.1 Онлайн-послуги Adobe, пов’язані з Членством. У залежності від того, чи Клієнт забезпечує на
постійній основі відповідність вимогам Угоди, а також своєчасно сплачує належний ліцензійний
збір, Adobe надає Клієнту невиключне обмежене право, закріплене за Територією, на доступ до
Програмного забезпечення і відповідної онлайн-послуги та їх використання (згідно з описом,
наведеним детальніше у розділі 16.4.1) в рамках Членства, відповідно до умов, встановлених у цій
Угоді та в Додаткових умовах використання (згідно з визначенням цього терміну, наведеним у
розділі 14.1.3 нижче).
2.2.2 Ліцензія на Програмне забезпечення, пов’язана з Членством. У залежності від того, чи Клієнт
забезпечує на постійній основі відповідність вимогам Угоди, а також своєчасно сплачує належний
ліцензійний збір, Adobe надає Клієнту невиключну обмежену ліцензію на встановлення і
використання Програмного забезпечення: (а) на Території; (б) протягом періоду дії та активності
Членства («Термін Членства») і (в) у спосіб, що відповідає умовам даної Угоди та застосовуваної
Документації. Після закінчення або припинення Терміну Членства (x) деяке або все Програмне
забезпечення може втратити працездатність без попереднього сповіщення, а також (y) Клієнт не
зможе користуватися Програмним забезпечення окрім випадку, якщо він відновив членство. Усі
умови, що відносяться до певного Програмного забезпечення, згідно з даною Угодою,
залишаються в силі і будуть застосовуватися до Клієнта та до використання ним даного
Програмного забезпечення.

2.2.3 Обмеження. Клієнт погоджується з наступними додатковими умовами та обмеженнями
щодо Членства: (а) Adobe має можливість змінити тип Програмного забезпечення (як то певні
продукти, компоненти, версії, платформи, мови і т. ін.), що визначається Членством, у будь-який
час і без жодної відповідальності перед Клієнтом за такі зміни; (б) від Клієнта може вимагатися
підключення до Інтернету та вхід на веб-сайт у будь-який час протягом Терміну Членства;
(в) Програмне забезпечення може автоматично підключатися до Інтернету з метою
підтвердження Членства Клієнта у будь-який час без сповіщення; а також (г) Клієнт не має
можливості уповноважувати або надавати дозвіл іншим особам на використання Програмного
забезпечення на правах Клієнта.
2.3 Файли інформаційного наповнення. Клієнт може використовувати, відображати, змінювати,
відтворювати та розповсюджувати будь-які файли інформаційного наповнення, якщо інше не
зазначено у файлах Read-Me, Документації або інших ліцензіях, пов’язаних із файлами
інформаційного наповнення. Проте Клієнту не дозволяється розповсюджувати файли
інформаційного наповнення окремо (тобто за обставин, коли файли інформаційного наповнення
становлять основну вартість продукту, що розповсюджується), а також пред’являти будь-які
права на товарний знак щодо файлів інформаційного наповнення або похідних робіт з їхнім
використанням. Жодне з положень даної Угоди не може впливати на власність Програмного
забезпечення згідно зі змістом розділу 3.
2.4 Зразок коду програми. Клієнт має можливість вносити зміни у форму вихідного коду
компонентів Програмного забезпечення, прямо визначених в супровідній Документації як зразки
коду, зразки програм чи фрагменти коду, файли класу ActionScript або зразки компонентів (кожен
з яких є «Зразком коду програми») виключно в цілях проектування, розробки та тестування веб-
сайтів та прикладних програм, створених за допомогою програмного забезпечення Adobe. Однак
копіювання та розповсюдження таких Зразків коду програми (змінених або незмінених) Клієнтом
дозволяється лише за умов дотримання всіх наступних вимог: (а) Клієнт розповсюджує лише
компільовані версії об’єктного коду зразка коду програми разом зі створеною прикладною
програмою; (б) Клієнт не включає зразок коду програми до будь-якого продукту або програми,
спроектованих для розробки веб-сайтів; (в) Клієнт не використовує найменування, логотипи,
значки чи інші товарні знаки компанії Adobe з метою просування створеної програми на ринку.
Клієнт погоджується гарантувати відшкодування, звільняти від відповідальності та захищати
компанію Adobe від будь-яких збитків, шкоди, вимог або позовів (включаючи винагороду
адвокатів), які можуть виникнути внаслідок використання або розповсюдження створеної ним
програми.
2.5 Мови програмування. Програмне забезпечення може включати частини ExtendScript SDK та
Pixel Bender SDK. За умови дотримання обмежень, зазначених у цьому розділі 2, компанія Adobe
надає Клієнту невиключну ліцензію без можливості передачі та без виплати авторської
винагороди на використання елементів у ExtendScript SDK та Pixel Bender SDK тільки для цілей
внутрішньої розробки прикладних програм, призначених для роботи з продуктами Adobe. За
винятком випадків, прямо передбачених у розділі 2.5, не дозволяється вносити зміни чи
розповсюджувати будь-які частини ExtendScript SDK або Pixel Bender. Клієнт погоджується
гарантувати відшкодування, звільнити від відповідальності та захистити компанію Adobe від будь-
яких збитків, шкоди, вимог або позовів (включаючи винагороду адвокатів), які можуть виникнути
внаслідок розповсюдження створеної ним програми.
2.6 Копіювання Документації. Клієнт має можливість створювати копії Документації для власних
внутрішніх потреб, пов’язаних із використанням Програмного забезпечення відповідно до цієї
угоди, але у кількості, що не перевищує розумно необхідну.
3. Права інтелектуальної власності.
Програмне забезпечення та всі його дозволені примірники, створені Клієнтом, є інтелектуальною
власністю компанії Adobe Systems Incorporated та її постачальників. Структура, організація та
--- Page 457 ---
вихідний код Програмного забезпечення є важливою комерційною таємницею і конфіденційною
інформацією компанії Adobe Systems Incorporated та її постачальників. Програмне забезпечення
охороняється законом, включаючи, окрім іншого, законодавство про авторське право США та
інших країн, а також норми міжнародних договорів. Якщо інше прямо не передбачено цією
Угодою, в ній не надається Клієнту жодних прав на інтелектуальну власність щодо Програмного
забезпечення. Усі права, якщо вони не надані прямим чином, продовжують належати компанії
Adobe та її постачальникам.
4. Обмеження та вимоги.
4.1 Зауваження щодо авторських прав. Будь-яка дозволена копія Програмного забезпечення
(включно (без обмежень) з Документацією), створена користувачем, має містити ті ж самі
зауваження щодо авторських прав та інші вказівки на авторську приналежність, ідентичні тим, що
містяться в Програмному забезпеченні.
4.2 Зобов’язання щодо використання. Клієнт погоджується не використовувати Програмне

Додаткову інформацію про передачу програмного забезпечення, яке використовується на умовах
корпоративного ліцензування, можна знайти на сторінці
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_ua.
4.6.3 Якщо програмне забезпечення вимагає повторюваної активації чи реєстрації, і Adobe на
запит Клієнта в порядку виключення знімає вимогу щодо такої повторюваної активації чи
реєстрації, тоді на додаток до обмежень, які набирають чинності згідно з умовами активації
(відповідно до положень розділу 14.3), право на постійну передачу прав, встановлене в
розділі 4.6.2, повинно в той же час втратити чинність, як тільки буде задоволено вказаний запит.
4.7 Заборона використання послуг центру підготовки до друку. Клієнту забороняється

4.9 Територія. Клієнт має право використовувати Програмне забезпечення та онлайн-послуги
Adobe лише на Території та у спосіб, що відповідає процедурі активації, викладеній на веб-
сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ua. Adobe може припинити дію наданої ліцензії або
призупинити Членство чи доступ до онлайн-послуг Adobe, якщо Adobe приходить до висновку,
що Клієнт використовує Програмне забезпечення або онлайн-послуги Adobe за межами
Території.
5. Оновлення.
Якщо програмне забезпечення є оновленням попередньої версії програмного забезпечення
Adobe («Попередня версія»), застосовуються наступні вимоги: Отже, якщо Клієнт належним
чином передає дане оновлення згідно з розділом 4.6, він повинен передати разом з оновленням
також Попередню версію програмного забезпечення. Якщо Клієнт бажає використовувати дане
оновлення разом з Попередньою версією, тоді Клієнту дозволяється це виконати лише на тому
самому Комп’ютері, де була встановлена та використовується Попередня версія. Будь-які
зобов’язання Adobe щодо підтримки Попередніх версій протягом Терміну дії ліцензії можуть бути
відмінені після появи даного оновлення. Будь-яке інше використання оновлення програмного
забезпечення не дозволяється. Компанія Adobe може надавати Клієнту ліцензії на додаткові
оновлення на умовах, що містять додаткові або відмінні положення.
--- Page 459 ---
6. Обмежена гарантія.
За винятком випадків, коли інше встановлено окремою угодою між Adobe і власником ліцензії,
компанія Adobe гарантує фізичній або юридичній особі, яка вперше придбаває ліцензію на
використання Програмного забезпечення на умовах цієї угоди, що Програмне забезпечення буде
функціонувати в основних рисах згідно з відповідним посібником користувача Програмного
забезпечення протягом меншого з двох періодів: (а) дев'яноста (90) днів або (б) Терміну дії
ліцензії після одержання Програмного забезпечення («Гарантійний період») за умови його
використання на Сумісному комп’ютері. Наявність несуттєвих відмінностей у характеристиках від
зазначених в посібнику користувача не є підставою для виникнення права на гарантійне
обслуговування. Ця обмежена гарантія не застосовується до наведених далі продуктів, які
надаються ЯК Є, без гарантій від компанії Adobe: (i) пакетів виправлення; (ii) програмних засобів
для роботи із шрифтами; (iii) передфінальних, початкових, оцінювальних версій, зразків продукту,
програмного забезпечення для оцінювання, а також примірників програмного забезпечення, не
призначених для продажу; (iv) веб-сайтів, онлайн-послуг Adobe та Онлайн-послуг третіх осіб;
(v) послуг сертифікації документів (див. розділ 16); а також (vi) будь-якого програмного
забезпечення, до якого компанія Adobe відкрила доступ для безкоштовного завантаження з веб-
сайту Adobe. Усі претензії стосовно гарантії повинні подаватися разом із підтверджуючими
покупку документами до відділу обслуговування клієнтів Adobe протягом визначеного
гарантійного періоду. Додаткова інформація щодо претензій, які стосуються гарантії, наведена на
сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/support_ua. Повна відповідальність компанії Adobe та її філій
стосовно зазначеної гарантійної претензії, а також єдиний та виключний засіб правового захисту
Клієнта, пов’язаний з будь-якою гарантією, обмежується, за вибором компанії Adobe, або
підтримкою Програмного забезпечення на основі гарантійної претензії чи заміною Програмного
забезпечення, або, якщо підтримка чи заміна за визначенням Adobe не можуть бути здійснені,
відшкодуванням Клієнту коштів, сплачених за ліцензію на Програмне забезпечення (якщо
сплачувалися). УВЕДЕНА В ДІЮ ПОЛОЖЕННЯМИ ЦЬОГО РОЗДІЛУ ОБМЕЖЕНА ГАРАНТІЯ НАДАЄ
КЛІЄНТУ ПЕВНІ ЮРИДИЧНІ ПРАВА. ЗГІДНО З ЗАКОНОДАВСТВОМ КЛІЄНТ МОЖЕ МАТИ
ДОДАТКОВІ ПРАВА, ЯКІ ВІДРІЗНЯЮТЬСЯ ЗАЛЕЖНО ВІД ЗАКОНОДАВСТВА КРАЇНИ. ADOBE

ОРГАНІВ СЕРТИФІКАЦІЇ ЗГІДНО АБО У ЗВ’ЯЗКУ З ВИКОНАННЯМ ЦІЄЇ УГОДИ ОБМЕЖУЄТЬСЯ
СУМОЮ, ЯКА БУЛА СПЛАЧЕНА ЗА ПРОГРАМНЕ ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ (ЗА НАЯВНОСТІ). ЦЕ
ОБМЕЖЕННЯ ДІЄ НАВІТЬ У ВИПАДКУ ПРИНЦИПОВОГО АБО ІСТОТНОГО ПОРУШЕННЯ ЦІЄЇ УГОДИ
АБО ПОРУШЕННЯ ЇЇ ПРИНЦИПОВИХ АБО ІСТОТНИХ УМОВ. Жодний пункт цієї угоди не обмежує
відповідальності компанії Adobe перед Клієнтом у разі смерті або нанесення тілесних ушкоджень
через недбалість компанії Adobe або через введення в оману (шахрайство). Компанія Adobe діє
від імені своїх афілійованих структур, постачальників та органів сертифікації у випадках, що
стосуються відмови, виключення та обмеження зобов’язань, гарантій та відповідальності, та ні в
яких інших випадках чи цілях.

райони Гонконг та Макау), Тайваню або Республіки Корея; або (г) Англії, якщо ліцензію на
Програмне забезпечення було отримано під час перебування Клієнта на території держави, не
зазначеної вище. Усі суперечки, пов’язані з цією угодою, підлягають розв’язанню у невиключній
юрисдикції округу Санта-Клара (Каліфорнія), якщо застосовується законодавство Каліфорнії,
окружного суду м. Токіо в Японії, коли застосовується законодавство Японії, та компетентних
судів Лондона в Англії, якщо застосовується законодавство Англії та Уельсу. Якщо застосовується
законодавство Сінгапуру, всі суперечки, які виникають у зв’язку з цією угодою, включаючи будь-
які питання про наявність, дійсність або припинення дії, мають бути представлені та остаточно
розглянуті арбітражним судом Сінгапуру відповідно до діючого арбітражного регламенту
Сінгапурського міжнародного арбітражного центру (SIAC), правила якого вважаються
невід’ємною частиною і на які посилається даний розділ. Призначається лише один арбітр, який
спільно обирається сторонами. Якщо арбітра не було обрано протягом 30 (тридцяти) днів з
моменту отримання письмового запиту від сторони, що є ініціатором звернення до арбітражного
суду, арбітр призначається головою SIAC. Офіційною мовою арбітражного розгляду є англійська.
Незважаючи на будь-яке з положень цієї угоди, Adobe або Клієнт мають право звернутися до
будь-якого судового, адміністративного або іншого органу з вимогою застосувати тимчасову або
охоронну міри, включаючи судову заборону, реальне виконання або іншій засіб судового захисту
за правом справедливості перед початком або під час судового чи арбітражного розгляду з
метою захисту своїх прав та інтересів або з метою забезпечити виконання конкретних умов, що
відповідають попереднім засобам судового захисту. Ця угода не повинна регламентуватися
наступними нормами, застосування яких у цьому документі однозначно виключається:
(x) нормами колізійного права будь-якої юрисдикції; (y) конвенцією ООН щодо договорів
міжнародної купівлі-продажу товарів; (z) Законом єдиного зразку про операції у сфері
комп'ютерної інформації, прийнятого у будь-якій юрисдикції.
11. Загальні положення.
Визнання будь-якого положення цієї угоди нечинним та неможливість його примусового
виконання не впливають на дійсність решти положень угоди, які залишаються чинними і можуть
бути виконані у примусовому порядку відповідно до умов угоди. Зміни до цієї угоди вносяться
лише в письмовій формі за підписом уповноваженої посадової особи компанії Adobe. З метою
інтерпретації або тлумачення цієї угоди використовується англійська її версія. Це угода між
компанією Adobe та Клієнтом щодо Програмного забезпечення є повною і відміняє будь-які
попередні заяви, обговорення, зобов’язання, повідомлення або рекламні оголошення, які
стосуються даного Програмного забезпечення.
12. Зауваження для кінцевих користувачів в Уряді США.
12.1 Надання ліцензії на технологію Adobe державним користувачам в США. Клієнт погоджується
з тим, що у випадках надання ліцензії на Програмне забезпечення Adobe державним органам
США або їх будь-яким підрядникам, ліцензії надаються у порядку, встановленому в CFR 48,
розділ 12.212 (для цивільних установ) та CFR 48, розділи 227.7202-1 та 227.7202-4 (для
Міністерства оборони). Стосовно кінцевих користувачів в Уряді США компанія Adobe
--- Page 462 ---
погоджується дотримуватись всіх чинних законів про рівні можливості, включаючи за належних
обставин положення виконавчого наказу 11246 з поправками, розділу 402 Закону про сприяння
реабілітації ветеранів В’єтнамської війни 1974 р. (38 USC 4212) та розділу 503 Закону про
реабілітацію 1973 р. з поправками, та положень 41 Кодексу федеральних правил, частини з 60-1
по 60-60, 60-250 і 60-741. Положення про ініціативні дії та норми, що містяться в попередньому
реченні, будуть включені до цієї угоди за допомогою посилання.
12.2 Промислові товари. Для кінцевих користувачів в уряді США Програмне забезпечення є

відповідності до CFR 48, розділ 12.212 або CFR 48, розділи з 227.7202-1 по 227.7202-4, залежно
від обставин, Комерційне комп’ютерне програмне забезпечення та Документація комерційного
комп’ютерного програмного забезпечення надаються кінцевим споживачами в Уряді США за
ліцензією: (а) тільки як Комерційні товари та (б) тільки з такими правами, які надаються усім
іншим кінцевим споживачам відповідно до умов і положень цієї угоди. Неопубліковані права
зберігаються згідно із законодавством США про авторські права.
13. Дотримання умов ліцензій.
Якщо Клієнтом є фірма, компанія або організація, він погоджується з тим, що на додаток до будь-
якої перевірки дотримання умов ліцензії за допомогою Програмного забезпечення, компанія
Adobe або її уповноважені представники матимуть право не частіше одного разу
на 12 (дванадцять) місяців з попереднім повідомленням Клієнта за 7 (сім) робочих днів на
проведення інспекційної перевірки його записів, систем і засобів з метою доведення
використання ним усіх і кожної програми чи послуги Adobe з дотриманням умов чинних ліцензій,
отриманих від Adobe. Наприклад, компанія Adobe має право на отримання записів Клієнта, які є
необхідними для визначення чи встановленому Програмному забезпеченню присвоєно серійний
номер, і Клієнт має надати такі записи компанії Adobe на першу на вимогу. Крім того, Клієнт має
надати для перевірки відповідності використання будь-якого програмного забезпечення Adobe
вимогам діючих ліцензій усі записи та інформацію на запит компанії Adobe протягом 30
(тридцяти) днів з моменту отримання запиту від Adobe. Додаткова інформація щодо присвоєння
серійного номера наведена на сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_ua.
14. Підключення до Інтернету та конфіденційність.
14.1 Автоматичні підключення до мережі Інтернет. Програмне забезпечення може спричинити
автоматичне підключення Комп’ютера Клієнта до Інтернету без додаткового повідомлення для
обміну даними із веб-сайтом або доменом компанії Adobe для таких цілей, як підтвердження
ліцензії та надання Клієнту додаткової інформації, можливостей і функцій. Якщо інше не
зазначено у розділах з 14.2 по 14.7, наступні положення застосовуються до автоматичних
підключень Програмного забезпечення до Інтернету:
14.1.1 Кожного разу, коли Програмне забезпечення встановлює підключення до Інтернету і
виконує обмін даними з веб-сайтом Adobe автоматично або внаслідок явного запиту
користувача, застосовується Політика конфіденційності. Зверніть увагу на те, що Політика
конфіденційності компанії Adobe дозволяє відстежувати відвідування веб-сайту та отримувати
детальну інформацію про теми, що відстежуються, використовувати файли cookie, веб-маяки та
інші подібні засоби.
--- Page 463 ---
14.1.2 Кожного разу, коли за допомогою Програмного забезпечення здійснюється з’єднання з
Adobe черезІнтернет, виконується збір та відправка певної інформації про Клієнта в Adobe за
допомогою Програмного забезпечення згідно з Політикою конфіденційності в електронній сфері
компанії Adobe, з якою можна ознайомитися на сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ua
(«Політика конфіденційності»).
14.1.3 Якщо Клієнт здійснює доступ до онлайн-послуги Adobe (у відповідності до розділу 16.4,
наведеного нижче) або активує чи реєструє Програмне забезпечення, тоді додаткова інформація,
як то ідентифікатор Клієнта в Adobe, ім’я користувача і пароль можуть передаватися та
зберігатися компанією Adobe згідно з Політикою конфіденційності, а також додаткові умови
використання відповідної онлайн-послуги Adobe (разом з умовами використання веб-сайту
Adobe.com і будь-якими застосовуваними умовами — «Додаткові умови використання»).
14.1.4 Відповідно до чинного законодавство або за згодою Клієнта Adobe має право
(а) направляти Клієнту транзакційні повідомлення з метою вдосконалення онлайн-послуги Adobe
або активації чи реєстрації Програмного забезпечення, або (б) здійснювати
внутрішньопрограмний маркетинг для надання інформації про Програмне забезпечення та інші
продукти та послуги Adobe з використанням інформації, в тому числі без обмежень, про версію
платформи, версію Програмного забезпечення, стан ліцензії та мову.
14.2 Оновлення. Програмне забезпечення може без попередження ініціювати автоматичне
підключення Комп’ютера Клієнта до Інтернету (періодично чи на регулярній основі) з метою
(а) перевірки наявності оновлень для завантаження і встановлення на Комп’ютер та
(б) сповіщення Adobe про результати спроб їх встановлення.
14.3 Активація. Програмне забезпечення може вимагати від Клієнта (а) отримання ідентифікатора
Adobe, (б) активації чи повторної активації Програмного забезпечення, (в) реєстрації
програмного забезпечення або (г) підтвердження Членства. Така вимога може без попередження
ініціювати автоматичне підключення Комп’ютера Клієнта до Інтернету під час встановлення,
запуску програмного забезпечення та на регулярній основі після вказаних дій. При підключенні
до Інтернету Програмне забезпечення збирає та передає інформацію до Adobe. Детальніше про
це див. на http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ua («Умови активації»). Програмне забезпечення
або Клієнт можуть також отримувати інформацію від Adobe, яка стосується ліцензії Клієнта,
підписки або Членства. Adobe може використовувати таку інформацію з метою виявлення або
запобігання шахрайству чи неавторизованому використанню всупереч чинній ліцензії, підписці
чи Членству. Невиконання активації чи реєстрації Програмного забезпечення, підтвердження
підписки чи Членства або виявлення компанією Adobe шахрайства чи неавторизованого
використання Програмного забезпечення призводить до скорочення функціональних
можливостей, непрацездатності Програмного забезпечення або до припинення чи призупинення
Членства.
14.4 Деактивація. У разі необхідності Клієнт може деактивувати та деінсталювати Програмне
забезпечення зі свого комп’ютера з метою встановлення та активації цього програмного
забезпечення на іншому комп’ютері згідно до умов цієї угоди («Деактивація»). Детальніше див.
на веб-сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ua. Для проведення деактивації необхідно
підключення до Інтернету.
14.5 Використання онлайн-послуг. Програмне забезпечення може без додаткового сповіщення
ініціювати автоматичне підключення Комп’ютера Клієнта до Інтернету (періодично чи на
регулярній основі) для забезпечення доступу Клієнта до інформаційного наповнення та послуг,
що надаються компанією Adobe або третьою стороною, як описано у розділі 16.4 («Онлайн-
послуги»). Крім того, Програмне забезпечення може без попередження ініціювати автоматичне
підключення комп’ютера до Інтернету для оновлення доступних для завантаження матеріалів цих
онлайн-послуг для надання таким чином негайного доступу до цих послуг, навіть під час роботи
Клієнта в автономному режимі.
--- Page 464 ---
14.6 Цифрові сертифікати. У програмному забезпеченні використовуються цифрові сертифікати
(згідно з описом, наведеним у розділі 16.5), що допомагають Клієнту ідентифікувати завантажені
файли (наприклад, прикладні програми та інформаційне наповнення) та видавців таких файлів. В
програмному забезпеченні Adobe AIR застосовуються цифрові сертифікати, щоб допомогти
Клієнту ідентифікувати видавця прикладних програм Adobe AIR. Сімейство продуктів Adobe
Acrobat також оснащене цифровими сертифікатами для здійснення та підтвердження дійсності
підписів в документах PDF та підтвердження дійсності самих завірених документів PDF.
Комп’ютер Клієнта може підключитися до Інтернету в момент підтвердження цифрового
сертифіката.
14.7 Диспетчер налаштувань. До Програмного забезпечення може входити програвач Flash
Player. Flash Player може зберігати на Комп’ютері Клієнта певні налаштування у вигляді
локального спільного використовуваного об’єкта. Вони асоціюються з примірником програми
Flash Player на Комп’ютері, дозволяючи Клієнту налаштовувати функції середовища виконання.
Диспетчер налаштувань Flash Player дозволяє Клієнту змінювати ці налаштування, включно з
можливістю обмеження третіх осіб щодо збереження об’єктів локального спільного
користування або надання інформаційному вмісту третіх осіб права доступу до мікрофона і
камери комп’ютера. Додаткову інформацію щодо налаштування своєї версії продукту Flash Player,
включно зі способами відключення об’єктів локального спільного користування в Диспетчері
налаштувань Flash Player, див. на веб-сторінці http://www.adobe.com/go/settingsmanager_ua.
Додаткову інформацію щодо об’єктів локального спільного користування див. на веб-сторінці
http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_ua.
15. Обмін даними між рівноправними вузлами.
Програмне забезпечення може без додаткового попередження використовувати підключення
Клієнта до локальної мережі для автоматичного підключення до іншого програмного
забезпечення Adobe, вказуючи у локальній мережі на його готовність до обміну даними з іншим
програмним забезпеченням Adobe. Протягом таких з’єднань може передаватися IP-адреса
підключення Клієнта до локальної мережі.
16. Особливі положення та винятки.
Розділ визначає особливі положення, які стосуються певних продуктів і компонентів програмного
забезпечення, а також обмежених виключень з вищенаведених умов. Якщо будь-яке положення
цього розділу суперечить у певному обсязі іншим умовам або положенням цієї угоди, положення
цього розділу мають переважну силу по відношенню до інших умов і положень.
16.1 Відсутність обмеження прав; положення щодо Європейської економічної зони; обов’язкове
повідомлення для Австралії.
16.1.1 Ця угода не обмежує визначені відповідними законодавствами права будь-якої сторони,
включаючи споживачів. Наприклад, для споживачів у Новій Зеландії, які придбали програмне
забезпечення для особистого, внутрішнього чи побутового (не пов’язаного із господарською
діяльністю) використання, ця угода регулюється законом про гарантії споживачів.
16.1.2 Якщо програмне забезпечення було придбано Клієнтом на території Європейської
економічної зони (ЄЕЗ), він зазвичай проживає на території ЄЕЗ і при цьому виступає в ролі
споживача (тобто, використовує Програмне забезпечення з особистою, не пов’язаною з
веденням господарської діяльності метою), дія положень розділу 6 («Обмежена гарантія») на
таку покупку та використання Програмного забезпечення Клієнтом не розповсюджується. Замість
цього Adobe гарантує відповідність функціональних можливостей Програмного забезпечення
вимогам відповідного посібника («узгоджені функціональні можливості») протягом 2 років з
моменту придбання за умови використання продукту на Сумісному комп’ютері. Незначні
відхилення від узгоджених функціональних можливостей не встановлюють будь-яких прав на
--- Page 465 ---
гарантійне обслуговування. ЦЯ ГАРАНТІЯ НЕ ПОШИРЮЄТЬСЯ НА ПРОГРАМНЕ ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ,
ЯКЕ ВИКОРИСТОВУЄТЬСЯ ЯК ПЕРЕДФІНАЛЬНА, ПРОБНА, ПОЧАТКОВА ВЕРСІЯ, ЗРАЗОК
ПРОГРАМИ, ПРОГРАМНЕ ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ ДЛЯ ШРИФТІВ АБО В ТАКІЙ КОНФІГУРАЦІЇ, КОЛИ
ПРОГРАМНЕ ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ ВИХОДИТЬ З ЛАДУ ЧЕРЕЗ ЗМІНИ, ВНЕСЕНІ В НЬОГО КЛІЄНТОМ.
Щоб подати гарантійну претензію, Клієнту необхідно повідомити про це відділ обслуговування
клієнтів Adobe протягом вищезазначених 2 років, представивши доказ придбання Програмного
забезпечення. Adobe перевіряє, чи дійсно програмне забезпечення містить зазначені дефекти,
або ж повідомляє Клієнта про те, що помилка виникла через неправильно виконану Клієнтом
установку (в цьому випадку Adobe надає Клієнту необхідну допомогу). Якщо буде встановлено
наявність дефекту у програмному забезпеченні, Клієнт має право вимагати від Adobe
відшкодування витрат на покупку або виправлення чи заміну своєї копії Програмного
забезпечення. Усі запити подаються з підтвердженням факту придбання. Якщо факти, викладені у
вимозі Клієнта про надання гарантійного обслуговування, підтверджуються, Adobe задовольняє
запит Клієнта щодо виправлення або заміни Програмного забезпечення, якщо це є доцільним для
компанії, або відшкодовує витрати на його придбання. З питань гарантійної підтримки
звертайтеся до відділу обслуговування клієнтів Adobe.
Зверніть увагу на те, що положення розділу 8 («Обмеження відповідальності») поширюються на
будь-які вимоги щодо відшкодування збитків, пов’язаних з використанням Програмного
забезпечення. Незважаючи на це, Adobe несе відповідальність за прямі збитки, які можуть бути
обґрунтовано передбачені у випадку порушення умов цієї угоди з боку Adobe. Клієнту
рекомендується вжити всіх розумних заходів для запобігання можливим збиткам та їх
зменшення, створивши резервну копію Програмного забезпечення і даних, що зберігаються на
комп'ютері.
Ця угода і зокрема її розділ 16.1.2 визначають усі права Клієнта (включаючи визначені
законодавством) на випадок виникнення проблем із використанням Програмного забезпечення.
Якщо визначені законодавством права Клієнта виявляються ширшими ніж ті, що описані в цьому
положенні, такі права мають переважну силу.
16.1.3 Жодне з положень цієї угоди (включаючи розділ 4.4) не обмежує будь-яких невідмовних
прав на декомпілювання Програмного забезпечення, передбачених для Клієнта чинним
законодавством. Наприклад, якщо Клієнт перебуває в Європейському Союзі (ЄС), він має право
за певних умов, передбачених чинним законодавством, декомпілювати програмне забезпечення,
якщо це необхідно для взаємодії Програмного забезпечення з іншим програмним
забезпеченням, при цьому Клієнт попередньо звертався у письмовій формі до Adobe із запитом
інформації, необхідної для досягнення цієї мети, і не отримав відповіді від Adobe. Крім того, таке
декомпілювання можете здійснюватись Клієнтом або іншою особою, яка має право
використовувати копію Програмного забезпечення від імені Клієнта. Компанія Adobe має право
висувати розумні умови, перш ніж надати таку інформацію. Будь-яка інформація, надана Adobe
або отримана Клієнтом, може у встановлених нижче межах використовуватись ним тільки для
цілей, визначених у цій угоді, і не може розкриватись будь-яким третім особам або
використовуватись для створення будь-якого програмного забезпечення, яке по суті є
аналогічним даному програмному забезпеченню, або використовуватись для будь-якої
діяльності, що порушує авторські права Adobe або її ліцензіарів.
16.1.4 Якщо Клієнт отримує Програмне забезпечення в Австралії, застосовується наступне
положення, незважаючи на все інше, зазначене в цій Угоді:
ПОВІДОМЛЕННЯ ДЛЯ КЛІЄНТІВ У АВСТРАЛІЇ:

16.2 Додаткові умови передфінальної версії Програмного забезпечення. Вимоги цього розділу
застосовуються до програмного забезпечення, яке представляє собою останню тестову версію
перед серійним випуском або бета-версію («Передфінальна версія програмного забезпечення»).
Передфінальна версія Програмного забезпечення не є кінцевим продуктом від компанії Adobe, а
отже може містити дефекти, помилки та інші недоліки, що можуть призвести до системних або
інших збоїв та втрати даних. Компанія Adobe може відмовитися від серійного випуску
передфінальної версії Програмного забезпечення. У разі отримання передфінальної версії
Програмного забезпечення за окремою письмовою угодою, наприклад ліцензійною угодою для
передфінальних версій Програмного забезпечення Adobe Systems Incorporated, використання
такого програмного забезпечення Клієнтом регулюється тією ж угодою. Користувач зобов’язаний
негайно повернути або знищити усі копії передфінальної версії Програмного забезпечення
якомога раніше після отримання вимоги від Adobe або після виходу остаточної версії такого
Програмного забезпечення у продаж. ВИКОРИСТАННЯ ПЕРЕДФІНАЛЬНОЇ ВЕРСІЇ ПРОГРАМНОГО
ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ ЗДІЙСНЮЄТЬСЯ НА ВЛАСНИЙ РИЗИК КЛІЄНТА. ЗВЕРНІТЬ УВАГУ НА РОЗДІЛИ 6
ТА 8 ЩОДО ВІДМОВИ ВІД ГАРАНТІЙНИХ ЗОБОВ’ЯЗАНЬ І ОБМЕЖЕННЯ ВІДПОВІДАЛЬНОСТІ, ЯКІ

ідентифікатора Adobe, згоди на Додаткові умови використання або вимагати сплати окремої суми
для отримання доступу до зазначеної онлайн-послуги Adobe. Онлайн-послуги Adobe можуть бути
доступними не на всіх мовах або для жителів не всіх країн, і компанія Adobe залишає за собою
право у будь-який час та за будь-якої причини змінити чи припинити доступ до будь-яких зі своїх
онлайн-послуг. Компанія Adobe також залишає за собою право почати стягувати плату за доступ
або використання онлайн-послуг компанії, які раніше надавалися безкоштовно. У розділі 14
надається важлива інформація щодо підключення до Інтернету та конфіденційності Клієнта. Як
зазначено у розділі 14, коли Програмне забезпечення ініціює доступ до онлайн-послуг компанії

Приклади онлайн-послуг третіх осіб включають серед іншого послугу Kodak EasyShare Gallery.
Доступ Клієнта до онлайн-послуг будь-яких третіх осіб та їх використання регламентуються
положеннями, умовами, відмовами від відповідальності та зауваженнями, які розміщено на
такому веб-сайті або іншим чином пов’язані з такими онлайн-послугами третіх осіб. Adobe не
контролює, не підтверджує і не бере на себе відповідальність за онлайн-послуги третіх осіб. Будь-
які контакти між Клієнтом та будь-якою третьою особою через онлайн-послуги третіх осіб,
включаючи політику конфіденційності таких третіх осіб та використання особистої інформації
Клієнта, постачання товарів та послуг або здійснення платежів за них, а також всі положення,
умови, гарантії і заяви, які стосуються таких контактів, виникають виключно між Клієнтом та
такою третьою особою. Онлайн-послуги третіх осіб можуть бути доступними не на всіх мовах або
для жителів не всіх країн, і компанія Adobe залишає за собою право у будь-який час та за будь-
якої причини змінити чи припинити доступ до будь-яких з онлайн-послуг третіх осіб.

витрати та винагороду адвокатів), що виникають через використання Клієнтом або у зв’язку з
ним чи внаслідок довіри до послуг такого органу, включаючи серед іншого: (а) довіру до
сертифікатів, термін дії яких закінчився; (б) неналежне підтвердження сертифіката,
(в) використання сертифіката, іншого ніж дозволений будь-якими застосовуваними умовами та
положеннями, цією угодою або чинним законодавством; (г) невиконання належних дій у
відповідності до правил в ситуаціях довіри до послуг видавця сертифіката чи до самого
сертифіката; або (д) невиконання будь-яких зобов’язань згідно з вимогами та умовами і
положеннями щодо послуг.
