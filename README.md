Online content
collection platform
for software licence
information

(Group 10
Consulting)

The team will develop a new application to collect, aggregate and
store content on commercial software licence agreements and/or
software support lifecycle dates. The application front end will

allow users to access and search the stored content.

Development of a prototype application including:
1) A data collection module to collect content from
web pages and online documents (PDF/Word/Text)
2) A database (or other data store) to capture the
collected content in a consistent and searchable
manner. Ideally this will include versioning of
content to capture changes over time.

3) A front end component to allow users to access
stored content and add content metadata. Ideally,
the front end will also allow users to compare
different versions of content and may include
capability to push alerts to users based on certain
criteria (for example, email alerts based on a
trigger)
